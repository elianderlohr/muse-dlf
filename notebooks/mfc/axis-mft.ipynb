       "['IMM-10005  PRIMARY  Immigrants without HOPE need help entering college  Anxiety gripped Jose Alvarado in third-period calculus class at North Atlanta High School. It mounted as students went around the room telling Mrs. Brooks where they would go to college: Emory. Georgia Tech. University of Georgia.  \"All I could say was, \\'I\\'m planning to see if I can get into a college because of my situation,\\' \" he recalled.  Alvarado earned a 3.5 grade-point average and 1110 on the SAT. He led the soccer team and was in the National Honor Society and the Latin and Spanish clubs.  Until recently, though, college seemed out of reach. That\\'s because when Jose Alvarado was four months old, his parents broke immigration law by bringing him from Mexico to the United States without permission.  By all outward appearances, Alvarado is as American as any other 17-year-old. He listens to the Dave Matthews Band and Tupac Shakur, watches \"The Simpsons\" and \"MTV.\"  But in the eyes of the law, he is an illegal immigrant. He has lived in Atlanta for six years, but most Georgia colleges would charge him out-of-state tuition. He qualified scholastically for a HOPE scholarship, but he can\\'t get it because of his immigration status. He\\'s ineligible for most student loans and cannot pay his own way because he lacks the Social Security number needed to work legally.  \"When I say I\\'m an illegal alien, my friends think it\\'s a joke. They can\\'t believe me because I don\\'t look the stereotype,\" said Alvarado, who speaks English at school and Spanish at home.  ',\n",
       " \"IMM-10006  PRIMARY  Reaction to Tancredo, Lamm as predicted  When Colorado Republican Congressman Tom Tancredo recently  joined with former Colorado Gov. Dick Lamm, a Democrat, to propose  a limited five-year moratorium on legal immigration, Tancredo said  he expected to be called a racist.  That, said the congressman, is what always happens  when the opposition to something can't fashion a coherent and  logical argument.  Well, Tancredo was right. A Denver Post editorial  quickly took a shot at Tancredo, suggesting that he 'bear in mind  that many Hispanics in Colorado aren't immigrants at all.' That's  fine, but why bring it up in a discussion about whether high rates  of legal immigration are, or are not, having an adverse effect on  Colorado's struggle with high population growth rates?  The notion that immigration critics couldn't  possibly be anything other than anti-immigrant - or, more  specifically, anti-Hispanic - was picked up and magnified in an  ensuing Denver Post column that suggested Lamm and Tancredo's proposed moratorium was akin to a proposal that people stop having  children. The columnist suggested, 'For the next five years,  Coloradans are to refrain from conceiving children. For the next  five years, all people from California, Texas and Chicago are  forbidden to move to Colorado.'  It is hard to know what to say to such a disjointed  argument. Conception rates are not now and never have been subject  to government edict. And freedom to travel is deemed by our  Constitution and by our courts as a fundamental right not subject  to government regulation. Immigration rates are, however, in a wholly different category. They are set by law, a law that by  definition is subject to change based on actual experience and  changing circumstances. Nor is there any question that the nation  has both a right and an obligation to enforce its laws as they  relate to illegal immigration.  \",\n",

       " 'IMM-10015  PRIMARY  Dangerous crossing; PURSUING DREAMS AND POSSIBLE AMNESTY, MEXICAN MIGRANTS RISK DEATH IN THE DESERT  Tohono O\\'odham Reservation, Ariz. Before they die, some of the dreamers who walk through this desert shriek, hallucinate and wander in circles.  Others, parched by the furnacelike heat, collapse and never regain consciousness.  Every day, Mexican migrants defy recent warnings that they avoid entering the United States through this vast mesquite and cactus-dotted American Indian reservation that nudges up against the Mexican state of Sonora.  And they continue to die.  Fleeing subsistence farming or wages that barely buy food, migrants are fortifying themselves with promises that jobs await them in such widely dispersed states as Georgia, New York, Tennessee, California, North Carolina, Texas and Illinois.  Evidence is growing that migrants also are embarking on their risky journeys in anticipation of a possible U.S. amnesty for the undocumented.  Next month, Mexican President Vicente Fox will visit President Bush in Washington, where the two leaders might announce proposals to reduce illegal immigration with a legalization program and guest-worker visas.  \"That was one of the reasons I wanted my family to be here,\" admitted Anicito Padilla, a native of the Mexican state of Guanajuato, who has worked for two years at a restaurant in Clearwater, Fla.  Padilla\\'s voice quivered with regret last week as he reflected on how his wife, Maria, and their six children had nearly died in their attempt to join him.  Maria gave most of their supply of water and food to her children during what turned out to be a three-day walk through the reservation west of Tucson. They suffered a nearly fatal experience that Padilla had not imagined when he hired smugglers who promised him his family\\'s trip would last just six hours.  ',\n",

There's Josefina Soto, 68, the matriarch whose home is the hub for countless weekend gatherings. There are her 11 children and their spouses. And there are her 23 grandchildren, some college-age, some barely out of diapers.  The family has grown so large over the years that the Sotos now celebrate Thanksgiving outside over four 20-pound turkeys, 12 pumpkin pies and a steady supply of rice and beans. But even as their numbers grow with each new grandchild, the Soto family is shrinking.  Armed with more diplomas, fatter wallets and loftier dreams, the current generation of the Soto family is choosing to have fewer children than the last. They and families like them are quietly slowing the Latino baby boom that is transforming the state. And as they do, they are offering California powerful evidence that the boom will ultimately diminish.  The longer Latinos live in the United States, the more their families begin to mirror those of other native-born Americans. Josefina Soto, like other Latino immigrants who have crossed the border, brought with her centuries-old traditions that value large families.  But like many other middle-class Americans, the newest generation of Sotos has begun to place greater value on careers and the perks that often come with having a small family: more summer vacations and after-school dance lessons.  \",\n",

Rene Hurtado, a member of the Treasury Police during his homeland\\'s civil war, learned Thursday that the U.S. Justice Department\\'s Board of Immigration Appeals upheld a September 1999 trial court that suspended his deportation.  The appeals board said Hurtado, whose real name is Gonzalo Jesus de Larin-Lara, convincingly rebutted evidence from the INS that he participated in war crimes and persecuted people during the war. The INS\\' evidence -- newspaper articles for which Hurtado was interviewed through Spanish-speaking interpreters -- contained inherently untrustworthy, unsworn statements, the board said.  \"The Immigration Judge found that the incident (Hurtado) admitted occurred -- having intercourse with a woman when he was on duty as a bribe to let her go -- was troubling, but not by itself sufficient to warrant a discretionary denial,\" a board member wrote. \"While we regard this incident as extremely troubling, we note that (it) occurred more than 20 years ago in the context of a civil war.  \"Since that time, the respondent spent several years speaking out to try and stop the abuses of the war.\"  Tim Counts, a spokesman for the INS in Bloomington, said the agency\\'s lawyers have not had a chance to fully review the decision or decide what, if any, action to take next.

Some view with disdain the changing cultural cadence of places like metro Atlanta and beyond, its effect on their way of life. Others are concerned that their taxes are being used to grant new arrivals access to schools and other services.  \"It\\'s a danger,\" said Donna Locke, coordinator for the Georgia Coalition for Immigration Reform, a mainstream advocacy group that wants reduced levels of immigration.  \"It wasn\\'t until the massive immigration in the late 1990s that (some) began to say, \\'What\\'s going on here?\\' It\\'s an attempt to overwhelm us by sheer numbers, undermine our laws and take control of our country.\"  In Gwinnett and Hall counties, demographic diversity has spawned signs of an anti-immigration movement already evident in places like Farmingville, a Long Island, N.Y., town. There, a fight against creating a hiring hall for Mexican day laborers has led to threats, intimidation and inflammatory rhetoric.  Last April in Hall County, a neo-Nazi group called the National Alliance staged an \"anti-immigration\" rally in Gainesville, a town populated by so many Mexicans that one retail strip is called \"Little Mexico.\"  And recently in Gwinnett, fliers were tacked onto cars in some Buford and Lawrenceville parking lots.

       " \"IMM-10077  PRIMARY  Mexico's Open Southern Border Lures Migrants Headed to U.S.  For illegal immigrants the world over, the narrow river that marks Mexico's southern border has long been a backdoor to the United States. All it takes to understand why is an afternoon view of the homemade rafts that swarm across the lazy currents.  At the river's edge in Guatemala, immigrants board the rafts along with housewives and day laborers going across the border to shop or work. The passengers get off less than 10 minutes later on the banks of Mexico, and never pass a single checkpoint or customs station.  The crossing is as easy as a ride on the Staten Island Ferry, and is in stark contrast to the northern crossing, where immigrants brace for the inhospitable deserts of Arizona and the military-style patrols along the Rio Grande.  Still, the end of the raft ride marks the beginning of a 1,500-mile journey fraught with peril.  Government officials report that hundreds of immigrants -- who come from as far away as Ecuador, Somalia and China -- are assaulted and raped by bandits, robbed by corrupt police officers and immigration officials, or abandoned by high-priced immigrant smugglers within the first legs of their journey. And according to government statistics, a soaring number of them are dying.  The number who died along the border last year rose to 136 from 29 the previous year, according to officials from Mexico's National Migration Institute. Close to 50 deaths have been reported so far this year.  \",\n",

The assessment is included in an annual evaluation of the border strategy by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The report said that while arrests have plummeted to record lows in some formerly troubled areas, such as San Diego, overall arrests on the border rose between 1994 and 2000.  The clampdown, which began in October 1994 has been extended to cities in Arizona and Texas that are hot spots for illegal crossings. Migrant smugglers have adjusted by taking back-country routes.  \",\n",
       " 'IMM-10099  PRIMARY  READER RESPONSES  Cheap labor is actually costly for U.S.  The Constitution\\'s editorial in favor of an amnesty/guest worker program for illegal aliens from Mexico fails to mention several key points (\"Regulate rather than reject work of illegal immigrants,\" July 26).  When immigration laws were enforced, Americans did the jobs now being done by foreign labor. Meat-packing and janitorial work paid a decent --- and sometimes middle-class --- wage because the supply of such workers did not greatly exceed the demand.  Illegal workers are attractive to employers because they do not unionize or demand much. If legalized, these workers would soon look for better jobs, and employers addicted to cheap labor would have to find more illegal workers.  Cheap labor is very expensive for taxpayers. Rice University economist Donald Huddle has placed the tab at $24.5 billion for 1996 alone. This cost continues to climb, as more and more people come here illegally and stay. JANE RUSSELL, Atlanta  Mexicans aided by our tax dollars  The statement in a recent letter that \"Mexicans who live and work in the United States are not fed, housed and educated at public expense\" is false (\"Column shows bigotry toward Mexicans,\" July 31).  According to the July 2001 report on Mexican immigration by the Center for Immigration Studies, welfare use is much higher among Mexican immigrants than native households in every state except Illinois. CIS reports 30.9 percent of households headed by Mexican immigrants receive aid from at least one major welfare program. One in 10 Mexican-immigrant households receives food stamps. The subsidized school lunch program is used by one in three Mexican-immigrant households, compared to 5.8 percent of native households. (The CIS report can be accessed online at www.cis.org.)

Anna Carlin started feeling uneasy last fall, right around the time that California\\'s Proposition 187 was making headlines.  The proposal, which bars illegal immigrants from receiving most public benefits, passed by a wide margin. It was followed by a rising chorus of calls from all over the country for tougher immigration controls. Carlin grew even more nervous.  Next, the new, Republican-led Congress started pushing to cut welfare and Social Security benefits to legal immigrants.  That\\'s when Carlin got really scared - and made a big decision. The Hungarian-born immigrant is trading in her green card and becoming an American citizen.  Why now, three years after she fell in love with an American and came to live in his country?  \"The Republicans,\" Carlin, 24, of Maple Shade, said bluntly. \"We hear Newt Gingrich saying that legal aliens, green card holders, shouldn\\'t get money. Why? We pay as much taxes as anyone else.\"  Thousands of other legal immigrants feel the same way. The number of people all over the country applying for U.S. citizenship has soared in the last six months, say officials at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.  \"The current Republican administration, and the push for Proposition 187, is giving people the idea that benefits will not apply to them if they don\\'t become citizens,\" said Lisa Jacobs, an INS spokeswoman.

Tomorrow\\'s earnest but flawed \"Dateline: The Promised Land\" - by producer Liz Cole and executive producer Marc Rosenwasser - devotes most of its time to the government\\'s shameful treatment of immigrants who arrived off the coast of Queens from China in 1993, aboard a rusting hulk of a freighter named the Golden Venture.  The hour-long report, one of several produced each year specifically for NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, focuses on the case of Pin Lin. Pin applied for asylum in this country citing persecution by the Chinese government for violating its harsh, mandatory population-control policies - policies that have been widely condemned by human-rights groups and government agencies alike.  The saga of the Golden Venture immigrants - many of whom spent months or years in prison as their applications wound through U.S. bureaucracies and courts - is hardly unknown or untold. \"The Promised Land\" tries to freshen its stories with the addition of the impassioned thoughts and feelings of American lawyers who found themselves representing some of the asylum-seekers, including Pin.  But the quest for emotional punch and visual style - count the soaring helicopter shots of the Statue of Liberty - leaves \"The Promised Land\" thin on the complexities of U.S. immigration policy and leaves unanswered some obvious questions raised by its own reporting.

Through its Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, the federal State Department will award 50,000 visas granting permanent residency to applicants.  In the past, people, sometimes posing as immigration lawyers, have cheated immigrants of thousands of dollars, often falsely assuring them that that they will win the lottery.  The commissioner of Consumer Affairs, Jane S. Hoffman, said: \"It is very important to realize that you don\\'t need to pay any person, any lawyer or any business to apply. You cannot pay a lawyer or business organization to get a green card or to automatically become a citizen.

Perhaps there is a third way, one that supports the Bush plan while addressing the fairness issue. A panel led by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft has recommended creation of a new, temporary guest-worker program that would allow for some of the workers to achieve permanent resident status over a period of time. This proposal doesn't have to be a straight giveaway: Those eligible would have to offer some proof of having worked in this country for a specified amount of time. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, for example, wants to allow some farm workers permanent status after working 150 days a year for four years.  Both the United States and Mexico already benefit economically from cross-border migration.

Eugenio\\'s decision to lock her daughter inside a small wooden trailer while she went to work rather than seek outside help from the many available services reflects an all-too-common fear among immigrants unfamiliar with California\\'s healthcare system, local and state health experts said Friday.

Under U.S. law, these people must prove that they are not intending immigrants, otherwise they would be ineligible for nonimmigrant status.  This process can be stressful, tiresome, even morale-deadening -- but it gets done thoroughly and in full compliance with U.S. law.

And he said local police should tell foreign nationals who are arrested that they have the right to contact their consulate.

There are 3 million Mexican-born people living illegally in the United States, according to a report last week by Mexico's National Population Council.  An immigration task force of top Justice and State Department officials planned to send Bush a report today on the broad outlines of U.S.-Mexico border issues. It will recommend that the United States take action to address illegal immigration, but will stop short of offering concrete proposals, a Justice Department official said Sunday.  The task force is considering several options, including a proposal to give the illegal Mexican immigrants permanent residency, said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. That is what Mexican President Vicente Fox has been pressing Bush for.  The official said major unanswered questions include how quickly the immigrants could earn legal status, and whether they would gain such status based on date of entry into the United States, or by occupation, such as farm worker.  The working group was formed after Bush and Fox met in February. Attorney General John Ashcroft and Secretary of State Colin Powell lead the task force, which hopes to have recommendations on such questions by September, when Bush and Fox meet in Washington.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-10245  PRIMARY  BUSH AIDES WEIGH LEGALIZING STATUS OF MEXICANS IN U.S.  President Bush's top immigration advisers are weighing plans to allow the more than three million Mexicans living illegally in the United States to earn permanent legal residency, officials involved in the deliberations said today.  The proposal is the most politically charged part of a draft plan on border safety and immigration that a panel led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft is expected to submit to the White House in the next few days. The legalization idea faces stiff opposition from anti-immigrant groups and influential Republicans in Congress.  The options under consideration involve different ways in which millions of Mexicans living in this country illegally could earn lawful status over the next several years, though not immediately, administration officials said. The options would quite likely be based on the immigrants'employment records, family ties in this country and how long they have lived in the United States.  Any plan to legalize the residency of unlawful immigrants would be in a broader agreement to expand guest-worker programs in the United States, the officials said. Many details of the plan, including whether to permit new guest workers to become permanent residents, are still unresolved and no final decisions have been made. Any plan would be subject to approval by Congress.  But pressure is mounting on the administration to address the issue as ground-breaking negotiations on immigration that Mr. Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico started in February are about to accelerate.  Secretary Powell and Mr. Ashcroft are to meet with their Mexican counterparts in early August. Mr. Bush and Mr. Fox want to announce a major migration initiative at their summit meeting in Washington starting Sept. 4, their aides say.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-10246  PRIMARY  DUTY, HONOR, BUT WHERE'S THE COUNTRY?  President Bush went to New York City last week and proposed a good, ambitious mission. He wants to spend $500 million so immigrants who are eligible to become citizens don't have to wait more than six months for processing.  Even if the president, as his critics suggest, offered the proposal to increase his standing among voters who are recent immigrants, the goal makes sense. As the president noted, the fact that America is the world's most popular immigration market is a compliment, not a problem.  But while Mr. Bush is setting lofty goals for government's most basic functions, he shouldn't overlook another group. Its members already are Americans. These Americans served their country in war, and all of them have been waiting much longer than six months for basic services their country owes them.  I speak of the nation's veterans, particularly those who live in Florida. They served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, and all they want is for America to help them with problems they encountered as a result of that service. But they are stuck in a state where, as editorials and columns in this section have shown, they get the justified sense that the country has forgotten them.  Florida vets may have it the worst  Roughly 1.7 million veterans live in Florida, and many of them are among the nation's oldest. They must wait nearly 18 months - at minimum - for the Department of Veterans Affairs to process their service-related claim for, say, hearing damage. Until recently, it was a struggle just to get a hearing aid.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-10249  PRIMARY  EDITORIAL Fox on a mission  The Mexican delegation led by President Vicente Fox has a valid  point in its contention that undocumented Mexican workers are  being shortchanged in places like Colorado, that won't, among  other things, issue driver's licenses to such workers.  That means workers aren't supposed to drive on roads they  helped build. They aren't entitled to health care in facilities  they helped build, and they can't attend institutions of higher  learning like state colleges, which they also contribute to in  labor and tax dollars.  Allowing Mexican workers to obtain driver's licenses, at the  very least, would help make the roads safer and result in more  insured drivers.  The Fox delegation is correct that undocumented immigrants  are being denied various services that they help support. Many  U.S. corporations and businesses thrive and citizens enjoy  comfortable lifestyles on the backs of undocumented workers.  In Colorado, about 46,000 undocumented workers pump millions  into the state's economy, and they aren't taking jobs away from  local residents. They perform services that most U.S. citizens  would not consider doing.  Yet, they do not share in the bounty of their labors. They  are barred from the institutions they help build and socially  alienated.  Since Mexican workers have built and contribute to this  society, they should be treated more fairly than they have been in  the past.  Fox is interested in this workforce because he knows it is  made up of Mexico's strongest and most ambitious people.  Ultimately, he would like to keep this workforce in his own  country, and who can blame him? The United States is far richer  and better off because of migrant workers from Mexico.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-10251  PRIMARY  BORDERING ON PROGRESS  The United States and Mexican governments are talking about ways to make migration across their border mutually beneficial. This is a quiet breakthrough; until recently, both sides considered the problem domestic and approached it unilaterally.  Mexican immigration has increased markedly in a relatively short time, according to a report released Thursday by the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors tighter borders. In 1970, the Mexican immigrant population in the United States was less than 800,000, compared with nearly 8 million last year. The flow of Mexican workers is overwhelmingly unskilled, a CIS study found, with almost two-thirds of the adult Mexican immigrants failing to complete high school. Bringing in unskilled workers tends to reduce wages for American workers who already are the lowest-paid in the chain and whose real earnings declined steadily through the economic boom of the 1990s.  Yet because of the strong economy, many unskilled native workers have acquired skills and risen to better jobs. Mexican immigration has been essential in helping fill the unwanted positions they left behind. In places such as Iowa, the shortage of laborers is so acute that the state government recruits immigrants. The Mexican economy benefits from the $6 billion annually that migrants in the United States, legal and illegal, send back to their cities and villages. The lure of migration has drained many of those communities of young men, however, and the Border Patrol's concentrated enforcement approach has heightened the danger of crossing illegally.  \",\n",

The Mexican government report, a snapshot of the nation's  approximately 8.5 million migrants in the United States, shatters  stereotypes and suggests that the basic character of the estimated  300,000 Mexicans who move across the border each year - legally  and illegally - is changing rapidly.  The study's 'profile of temporary migrants' section, for  example, finds that the labor flow has shifted from peasant  villagers to urban dwellers. The overwhelming majority of migrants  now work in U.S. commercial and service sectors rather than farms,  tend to stay longer and are more likely to establish permanent  U.S. residency, the report finds.  The migrants' ultimate destinations are changing as well:  California still absorbs more temporary workers than any other  state - about 28 percent - and remains home to two-thirds of all  Mexicans residing permanently in the United States. But the report  stresses: 'The most recent data indicate that the state has lost  relative importance, principally in favor of Texas and other destinations, above all due to the reinforcement of the U.S.  Border Patrol in California.'  Among the study's most potentially far-reaching findings is  that more than half of all Mexicans in the United States have high  school diplomas or advanced university degrees - a red flag, it  states, that warns of significant brain drain from a Mexican  economy more in need of professionals than before. The report does  not indicate on which side of the border they had received their degrees.  \",\n",

But what must a city do to become attractive to immigrants?  A look at two medium-sized cities -- St. Louis and Pittsburgh -- can be instructive in understanding the allure of immigration.  Pittsburgh received something of a black eye when The New York Times ranked it last among the 25 biggest metropolitan areas in terms of the number of immigrants to arrive here. The net international migration into the city was 8,935 persons. or about 0.4 percent of the 1999 area population of 2,331,336. St. Louis, with a 1999 population of 2,591,456, did somewhat better with a net international migration of 25,310, or 1.0 percent.  A cursory look at both cities suggests a number of factors that should work in their favor in drawing foreign-born residents. Both have high-quality, affordable housing, rich cultural institutions, prestigious universities and strong biotechnology and medical research industries. One would think these quality-of-life features would be draws to immigrant groups seeking new homes.  So how do these two cities do better at attracting immigrants?  * The first place to look for an explanation -- and the first place to start making changes -- is the structure of the local economy. Moreover, the cities that are doing well in attracting immigrants have strong entrepreneurial components and plenty of venture capital to help finance start-ups.  ',\n",

In Bosnia, all houses have an area in which people enter the house, take their shoes off and then go into living room through another door. In St. Louis houses, you enter directly into a living room, and you can almost see what every room looks like. Many Bosnian women complain about this.

She planned to stay in San Francisco for several weeks as the houseguest of an old friend of her father, then travel to Mexico.  However, immigration officers at Lambert did not like certain aspects of her plan. They did not like the fact that she had only $ 445 in her purse. They did not like the fact that she had a one-way ticket to California, not a round-trip ticket to Dublin.  Maybe she was naive about the rules, as young people tend to be. Maybe she had hidden motives, as young people sometimes do. Maybe she was just confused, as young people almost always are.  In any case, she was taken to a holding area and questioned in detail. Did she use drugs? Had she ever been to the United States before? If she had the chance to go to college here, would she try to stay?

Focusing on what may be the largest influx of immigrants in our history, journalist Michael Barone seeks to clarify the issue, but with limited success.  There are few more astute observers of American politics than Barone, co-author of the indispensable Almanac of American Politics. He has an eye for telling detail: Did you know that the founder of Planters Peanuts was an Italian immigrant who settled in Virginia just before World War I? And his brief analysis of the 1965 immigration law, on which current policy is based, is politically astute.  But Barone\\'s larger analysis is flawed. As his subtitle suggests, he thinks that America can and should repeat its historical success with assimilation. Noting that \"we\\'ve been here before,\" he argues: \"Minority groups of 2000 resemble in important ways immigrant groups of 1900. In many ways blacks resemble Irish, Latinos resemble Italians, Asians resemble Jews.\" Of these three comparisons, the most familiar and least controversial is between Jews and Asians, both groups having been manifestly successful. The difficulties arise with the other two comparisons.  Barone wisely notes that \"the notion that all immigrants from Europe were regarded as white Europeans and accepted without prejudice is an artifact of 1990s \\'multiculturalism\\' and an anachronism with no historical basis.\" And he highlights the fundamentally different situations of blacks and Latinos, challenging \"the underlying assumption that a characteristic American racism subjects all \\'people of color\\' to discrimination that produces similar responses.\"  ',\n",

St. Louis University has received since Sept. 11 \"moderately more\" calls than usual from the immigration agency, just checking to see whether individual students are enrolled, spokesman Jeff Fowler said.  The agency long has had the legal right to certain types of information about foreign students, and colleges are obliged to keep it and give it to the agency when it asks. Administrators who work with foreign students at colleges in the St. Louis area say the agency has always asked for the information - periodically.

In addition, the conference was to feature two 45-minute sessions with the legendary Zig Ziglar, often called \"America\\'s No. 1 motivational speaker,\" the leader in the fight against \"stinking thinking.\"  Ziglar usually charges from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 plus all expenses to deliver the keys to success and happiness.

Citing the \"menace of terrorism\" after the Sept. 11 attacks, South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon last week offered to enlist South Carolina law enforcement officers to assist the INS investigative branch.  \"Working alone, the federal government cannot fully enforce our immigration laws,\" Condon wrote in a letter to U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. \"The INS cannot possibly be everywhere at once.\"  Condon\\'s offer to the INS --- which has only 2,000 investigators nationwide --- is the first from any state. It comes after years in which some police departments have been ordered to keep their distance from immigration officials.  Congress first authorized the idea of enlisting local help for the INS in a 1996 federal law, which allows the attorney general to deputize police departments that volunteer to assist in enforcing immigration laws. The provision has never been used, however.  After the law passed, then-Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department would have to establish training and procedures for enforcing immigration laws.  She agreed to run a test project with the Salt Lake City police department in 1998, but it never got off the ground. Immigrant groups protested that the police-INS partnership would invite discrimination against those who looked or sounded foreign.  ',\n",

He woke up in his Juarez home in the state of Chihuahua at 3  a.m. Then he waited 21/2 hours to drive 1 mile across the border  into this bustling town of 700,000, where he works restoring  antique furniture.  'The line is all the way into Mexico,' he says as he nears the  U.S. border, where police and immigration inspectors meticulously  search every vehicle, an average of 49,000 a day. 'It took an hour  just to reach the bridge in Mexico.'  The El Paso/Juarez crossing is one of dozens along the  U.S.-Mexican border.  The delays are hurting the El Paso and Juarez economies.  Shoppers vital to hundreds of El Paso shops aren't coming - sales  at the town's two largest malls are down 30 percent compared with  last year. And Juarez shopkeepers are missing American shoppers.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-10371  PRIMARY  Mexican official faces sentencing for role in smuggling of aliens  EL PASO, Texas - Next month, a Mexican immigration official  will be sentenced for guiding a massive alien-smuggling ring that  ferried 132 illegal immigrants between 1996 and 1998 from the  Middle East into the United States via the Mexican border.  Some of the immigrants had known ties to terrorist  organizations in Syria, Iraq and Jordan.  Salvador Moreno, a Mexican immigration agent, was extradited  from Mexico in February 1998 for conspiracy to smuggle illegal  aliens into the United States. On Sept. 11, Moreno pleaded guilty  to the charge.  The ringleader of the operation, George Tajirian, a  57-year-old Iraqi-born Mexican citizen, who prosecutors say  pocketed $ 1.25 million from his smuggling ring in 1996 and 1997,  was sentenced in 1998. Prosecutors say Tajirian coordinated the  transportation of more than 1,000 Middle Eastern aliens into the  United States beginning in 1980.  'The tightening of our borders and our internal security to  stem the tide of international violence is a priority and the  desire of the American public,' wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney J.  Brandy Gardes in Tajirian's sentencing brief. 'The defendant's  criminal activity, through its sheer magnitude and cavalier attitude, struck deeply at these goals. The defendant, simply put,  had no scruples when it came to decisions on who he would aid in  entering the United States illegally. As a result, in two years, a  person sought internationally for genocide, two members of the  Palestine Liberation Organization and a person wanted for murder  were assisted by this defendant.'  \",\n",

This mandate must be part of the anti-terrorism bill being negotiated by the House and Senate.  Already, 94 airlines use the electronic Advance Passenger Information System. But a dozen have refused. That should no longer be an option. If a carrier does not cooperate, it should be denied landing rights in the U.S.  APIS, developed in 1988, collects biographical information - name, date of birth, country of residence, etc., - from passengers before departure. Before the flight lands here, the list is checked against a database linked to the Customs Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, FBI and 21 other federal agencies. Currently, Customs receives information on about 75% of passengers arriving on international flights. That puts an unacceptable 25% outside the security net.  Most of the carriers that have balked at sharing their passenger lists are from Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan and Pakistan. Pitiful.  They seem to have a philosophical problem. Sharing the manifests, they contend, would lead to racial profiling of their passengers. Such sensitivity.

Bigger changes appear likely. At congressional hearings over the past two weeks, legislators have promised to provide more money for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and called on the agency to implement plans to track foreign visitors and students that have languished for years.  Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary immigration subcommittee and a longtime champion of pro-immigrant policies, signaled the change in tone yesterday when he told a hearing: \"Clearly, the screening of foreign nationals who seek entry into the U.S. must be improved.\"  Kennedy and Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) are expected to announce legislation in the next few days that would fund systems to track foreign students and visitors and require additional training for U.S. officers who issue visas.  Until Sept. 11, the U.S. immigration system had focused less on terrorism than on barring foreigners seeking to work here illegally. With demand for workers rising during the economic boom of the late 1990s, the government was considering expanding the number of temporary immigrants allowed into the country.  But the FBI\\'s conclusion that 19 foreign nationals carried out the deadly airplane hijackings in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania has transformed the politics of immigration. The hijackers all apparently were issued non-immigrant visas at U.S. consulates. At least three stayed in this country beyond their visa deadlines, according to the INS.  ',\n",

Since good fences make good neighbors, we\\'ve been justifiably worried about the border with our friend and neighbor to the north.

They breeze through Customs with little paperwork and are whisked away to their final destination: cemeteries.  In a little-known offshoot of the Chinese immigration wave, human bones and ashes exhumed from graves in the Far East are arriving in the Bay Area in record numbers. This rush to rebury is caused primarily by impending communist rule in Hong Kong.  Immigrants fear the new regime will dig up graves to make way for construction. Space in Hong Kong already is at such a premium that burial plots are leased for seven years only.  For the many Chinese who believe good treatment of the dead is an insurance policy for the living, the prospect of disturbed graves is terrifying.  In fact, caring for grave sites is so much a part of Chinese culture that three days are set aside each year to honor the dead. Today busloads of Chinese will flock to cemeteries for the last memorial day celebration of the year.  Reburials are a result of the Chinese immigration boom. The Chinese traditionally bury loved ones together, close to home. In pre-communist China, the Chinese who died here were shipped back. Now migration is reversed.  And that has created a lucrative market for cemeteries eager to cater to Chinese immigrants willing to pay $ 2,000 to $ 10,000 for good burial plots.  ',\n",

There is a lack of coordination and intelligence sharing among the many agencies responsible for border control, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Customs Service and the Coast Guard, Flynn said.  The agencies have separate communications systems and computer systems and lack the manpower to patrol the borders adequately, he said.  For example:  - Although Canadian officials believe there may be up to 50 terrorist groups operating just over the U.S. border in Canada, the Border Patrol has only 330 agents and one analyst to cover the 4,000 mile border between the two countries.  - Although U.S. trade with Canada has increased fourfold since 1985 to about $410 billion, the U.S. Customs Service has only 700 inspectors on the northern border - 200 less than 20 years ago. Half the inspections booths at crossings in Washington state, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont and Maine are routinely closed because of a lack of Customs and INS inspectors.  - Coast Guard ranks are the lowest since 1964 and the services has had to cannibalize many of its decades-old cutters and aircraft for spare parts to keep others operating.

The INS compiled the information based on material provided by the FBI.

Their persistence in exploiting loopholes forced U.S. officials to confront a monumental question after the Sept. 11 attacks: Can a broken system, designed to police millions of people who come to the United States in search of a better life, be quickly reconfigured to capture the few who arrive in pursuit of a life of terror.  The challenges are daunting, interviews and a review of federal and congressional audits and INS records show. The attacks against the Pentagon and the World Trade Center highlighted numerous problems:  * International students, sponsored by 15,000 universities, colleges and vocational schools, have been considered a potential security risk for nearly two decades. The federal Immigration and Naturalization Service fails to keep track of foreign students and ignores scores of second-tier schools that offer aviation and specialized training to foreigners.  * The INS is unable to track more than 3 million foreign nationals who are overstaying their visas. Record-keeping is so incomplete that the INS has no record of six of the 19 suspected Sept. 11 hijackers entering the country, though they are believed to have come through ports of entry with legitimate visas.  * Counterterrorism has never been a top INS priority and the agency is ill-equipped to handle it.

Instead, the 27-year-old student from Morocco was standing Tuesday in a federal office in suburban Washington, counting out $ 5,000 in crisp $ 100 bills.  Jad had come to bail out his cousins, Faical Chafouk and Mohamed Oushain, jailed for three weeks by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for taking jobs in a pizza parlor, a violation of the terms of their student visas.  The real reason for their detention, of course, was law enforcement\\'s dragnet for Arabs and Muslims cast after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But when asked if he was angry about the ethnic profiling that had snared his cousins, Jad said, \"I am, and I\\'m not.\"  A part of him felt sympathy for the predicament of law enforcement authorities, especially the INS. \"I think they\\'re doing their job for the safety of the people. They just don\\'t know what\\'s going on right now,\" Jad said.  Three weeks after the worst terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil, the INS - one of the most maligned agencies in the federal government - has been garnering generally good reviews for its procedures in the aftermath of the crisis.  Much criticized in the past for its slow processing of immigration papers and often abusive treatment of asylum seekers and foreign visitors, the agency now seems to be getting the benefit of the doubt as it finds a new footing in a changed world.

Those workers, among hundreds who stream into the offices of Associacion Tepeyac day after day, are among those who worked off the books. They have no Social Security numbers. Most lack a driver's license. They have no pay stubs; they were paid in cash.  As a result, they have had a thornier trip through the maze of disaster relief than most have. For those who worked off the books, seeking relief can mean openly declaring their illegal immigration status. And they must deal with relief workers, who, constantly on guard for hustlers, require some documentation.  Vast confusion has reigned at relief centers across the city, immigrants' advocates say. Sometimes, they say, relief workers are unaware of what kinds of benefits are available for illegal immigrants, and what kinds of documents they need to bring. Sometimes, those who lack documents simply walk out the door when they are asked to furnish a Social Security number; in some cases, they do not actually need one. In the most dire cases, the families of illegal immigrants who are missing have been unable to obtain a letter from an employer.  \",\n",

One critic of the trend is Amnesty International. In a report being put out on Thursday in London, the rights group warns that \"In the name of fighting \\'international terrorism,\\' \" governments have rushed to introduce new measures that threaten the human rights of their own citizens, immigrants and refugees.\"  It cited a wave of attacks on Muslims and other foreigners in the United States, Europe and Australia and efforts by governments from Hungary to China to increase the powers of the police and security officials.  The situation is delicate in Central Europe, where some leaders now in office spent time in jail in the Communist era for their protests on behalf of human rights. The Czech president, Vaclav Havel, who spent five years in prison, has said that some rights may have to be restricted after the attacks in order to protect larger freedoms. But he criticized a growing climate of intolerance for dissenting political opinions in the country.  \"Expressing critical thought is considered to be favoring the terrorists,\" Mr. Havel told a newspaper. \"That is what I consider extremely dangerous.\"  In the Czech Republic, the lower house of Parliament rushed to approve a bill easing the access of the police and intelligence services to private records, including telephone records, without judicial oversight.

Twenty-five counties in Georgia, more than in any other state, experienced a 50 percent or more rise in immigration from 1990 to 1998, according to the study released Wednesday by the Center on Immigration Studies in Washington. The private research group seeks to reduce the immigration flow.  The study provides a clear statistical picture of what journalists and demographers have been reporting: a major dispersal of newcomers, who for decades tended to stay in California, New York, Florida and Texas.  It designated 223 counties nationwide as the \"new Ellis Islands\" based on increases of at least 50 percent in the foreign-born population. Most are in the South and Midwest.  Steven Camarota, the author of the study, said he compared the number of foreign-born residents from the 1990 Census with the number of permanent visas granted by the United States from 1991-98 for each county.  Camarota said that county Census numbers for 2000, which are not yet available, would almost certainly increase the estimates of new arrivals. The Census includes illegal residents as well as legal visa holders.  Most of these counties are in the South and Midwest, Camarota said, adding that his data did not include illegal residents.  Newcomers from Mexico and India, as well as refugees from a variety of counties, especially Vietnam and the former Soviet Union, make up the largest numbers of new residents in the South and Midwest, Camarota said.

He was trying to flee religious persecution and rejoin his parents and an older brother, who had left Iran for a new life in Atlanta.  Unless the U.S. government acted with unusual speed, though, Baghramian Milagerdi would be trapped in Iran for several years, the victim of a quirk in immigration law that causes hardship for refugees with relatives in the United States.

Looking just at border control, I'd like to point out four areas of reform:  One Agency. For decades we have talked about consolidating and reorganizing agencies that are involved with border control, yet four separate departments still have various roles in this effort. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is charged with inspections at ports of entry. Before visitors get to the port of entry, they must obtain a visa from the consul at the U.S. Embassy in the foreign country. Of course, some countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan have reciprocal visa waiver programs in place with the United States, and for nationals of those countries a visa is not required. INS is part of the Justice Department, while Consular Affairs is under the State Department. Goods shipped to the U.S. are checked by Customs, which is under the Treasury Department. Customs is well funded and equipped, and has a fleet of helicopters that dwarfs the air capability of the INS, which has the primary responsibility for border control between the ports of entry.

Instead, most are being held on immigration charges and traffic violations, and virtually none has been publicly identified.

The number of such visas, however, would be cut from 55,000 to 27,000 a year.  The panel voted 18 to 8 in favor of an amendment by Rep. Charles Schumer (D-Brooklyn) to keep the diversity program shortly before it approved an immigration reform bill on a 23-to-10 vote.  The overall bill would reduce legal immigration from nearly 900,000 a year to less than 600,000, and tighten requirements for entry under the largest category, which promotes reuniting families. By reducing priority for adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens, the change could fall hardest on Asians.  The measure also seeks to crack down on illegal immigration by setting up a phone-in system for employers to verify the eligibility of job applicants to work.  The Senate plans to consider similar legislation.  The diversity program, originally sponsored by Schumer and in effect since last year, boosted immigration by nationalities who were largely shut out by the family reunification provisions because their closest relatives were not U.S. citizens.

Though neither Fox nor President Bush expects to dissolve the 2000-mile border overnight, the Mexican leader clearly prefers sooner rather than later. In Washington this week, Fox surprised his friend and fellow rancher president by calling for sweeping American immigration reform by year\\'s end.  Currently, U.S. government immigration policy echoes its position on gays in the military: Don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell.

If America cracked down and rounded up all those workers, the nation\\'s agricultural and construction industries would collapse, says Jagdish Sheth, Emory University\\'s Kellstadt professor of marketing.  Despite American dependence on their labor, undocumented workers still live in the shadows and under threat of deportation, and Fox is right to insist that Mexicans working, paying taxes and obeying the law have \"all their legal rights when they\\'re living here in the United States.\"  Those rights don\\'t have to spring from legal residency.

State law says only U.S. citizens or people who are in this country legally can get a license. That means a few hundred thousand illegal immigrants cannot get a license, but many drive anyway. Advocates say it makes sense to license them so they can learn the rules of the road and buy auto insurance. They say illegal immigrants constitute a large group of uninsured motorists on Georgia highways, a group that could increase insurance premiums if they are involved in wrecks. One group that opposes licenses for illegal immigrants, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, spells out its arguments on its Web site.

The indictment says Tyson \"did cultivate a corporate culture in which the hiring of illegal aliens . . . was condoned.\" Tyson denies that, saying the managers acted on their own.  There is substantial evidence, however, that illegal immigrants play a large role in the poultry business, which in Georgia accounts for $13 billion a year.  \"The industry is very dependent on these individuals,\" said Grace Comontofski, a board member of the Georgia Poultry Alliance, a nonprofit Gainesville group that promotes the rights of poultry workers.  Latino leaders in Georgia say thousands of poultry workers are illegal immigrants attracted by low-skill jobs that require little English and pay better than jobs back home.  Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin hesitated when asked about illegal immigrants in poultry plants.

A hearing date for Al-Najjar, 44, is expected within a month.  After spending three years and seven months in jail, Al-Najjar was released last December after a ruling by federal Judge R.

For educators and civil rights officials, the schools raise questions that have long dogged special programs: Do they truly help children or risk harm by isolating them from the mainstream?  These are not only pedagogic questions, but also legal ones. The Department of Education\\'s Office of Civil Rights, concerned about segregation, has investigated immigrant programs. In an investigation of a California school that has served as a benchmark for cities setting up other immigrant schools, the department gave voice to an informal guiding principle: The schools should aim to be transitional; students should probably not stay beyond a year.  But in his plan for New York\\'s Newcomers School, which would open in September in Long Island City, Queens, Mr. Cortines proposes allowing the students to remain for up to four years. The 1,000 high school students, who would attend voluntarily, would have the option of graduating from there. That could be a problem.  In 1990, Federal investigators said a so-called newcomer elementary school in Sacramento, Calif., would violate civil rights segregation laws if it kept children for more than a year without transferring them to regular schools.

A plan to liberalize immigration from Mexico, which appeared imminent in early September, has been shelved for now. Instead, the administration and Congress have launched a broad crackdown on immigration violations, and they have restricted border crossings. Even legal aliens, it has been made clear, do not have the same rights as American citizens when it comes to privacy and detention.

Thousands of immigrants who face deportation proceedings but fail to appear for hearings have been ordered almost routinely to be deported.  But a decision issued in October by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals halts that practice, unless the Immigration and Naturalization Service can show that it has delivered a notice of the proceedings to the immigrant.  Although foreign residents have been required by long-standing --- but unenforced --- federal law to report changes of address to the U.S. government, the rule shifts the burden of finding current addresses to the INS.

Two months ago, most of the no-shows would have been ordered in absentia to be deported. But the judge ordered deportation for only one: a man from El Salvador who had been found hidden in a truck in Arizona with 100 other undocumented immigrants.

Thirty-two people were indicted in \"Operation Great Basin,\" including the president and other corporate officers of Golden State Transportation, a regional bus company, and six alleged smugglers, Ashcroft said.

Though blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other nonwhite groups now constitute 31 percent of the population, up from 24 percent in 1990, the new housing data demonstrated a startling degree of isolation: Hispanics and Asians are living in more heavily Hispanic and Asian neighborhoods than they were 10 years ago, while whites and blacks are only slightly more exposed to one another than they were in 1990.  But the truth is that immigrants are assimilating faster than they used to. The immigrants from the golden age of assimilation, mostly from Europe, took two or three generations to leave the ghettos they first settled in, and at least that long to begin intermarrying in large numbers; the new immigrants, arriving since 1965, simply haven\\'t had time to master the language and culture. According to John R. Logan, a sociology professor at the State University of New York at Albany, \"Italians and Jews were more segregated in the first 30 years after their arrival than Asian groups are today.\" The same is true, he says, for Hispanics, except for those on the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.  It is not assimilation that has failed; it is integration -- the word we use specifically for the incorporation of African-Americans into the mainstream. In \"Beyond the Melting Pot,\" published in 1963, Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan portrayed blacks as migrants from a Southern rural culture to a Northern urban one, subject to essentially the same dynamic as immigrants. The new census data provide further evidence that -- as both have long since conceded -- they were wrong. Blacks\\' residential exposure to whites, like intermarriage rates, has increased every decade since 1970, but most scholars are much less struck by the progress than by how modest the numbers remain.

That was the day the military toppled the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, causing his death. Ms. Allende, a second cousin of Mr. Allende, fled soon after.  That two barbaric events in the Americas happened on the same date is an eerie coincidence that startles Ms. Allende and other Latinos now living in the United States. But what resonates with many is not so much that violence has chased them to a new, democratic country. Instead, they are dreading what could come after -- and in their homelands often did.  Latino immigrants -- Chileans, Peruvians, Argentines, Uruguayans, Bolivians, Panamanians, Cubans, Venezuelans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Dominicans and Nicaraguans -- fled countries where ardent nationalism was often one step toward an increasingly authoritarian government; and where the military, at one point or other, ruled at will. Ideologies of the right and left were able to trump democracy repeatedly in the 20th century.  Apart from economics, this is a crucial reason that many Latinos have emigrated to the United States, a country where, they know, an Army general would not attempt a coup d'etat, nor would citizens allow it. In fact, the fastest rate of growth among Latino immigrants in the last decade was not among Mexicans, as in the past, but among Central and South Americans, who suffered the brunt of the hemisphere's most repressive regimes and bloody civil wars in the last three decades. Their numbers nearly doubled to 10 million by the year 2000, the Census shows.  \",\n",

Officially, the city\\'s population is 5,700, according to the U.S. census. City officials believe the number is closer to 7,000, thanks to a steady influx of Hispanic immigrants in the past five years.  Much of the immigration involves people looking for jobs at the Excel Corp. hog-processing plant. Patterson said there is a view in the community that immigration has helped ensure the future of Excel, the city\\'s largest employer.  No one knows how many Hispanic residents are in Beardstown illegally. But Patterson recalled an incident this year in which 22 illegal immigrants were picked up in a traffic stop.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service seldom has the manpower available to pick up illegal immigrants in rural communities such as Beardstown.

Attorney General John Ashcroft declared that an unspecified number of those in custody have been linked to Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network - but he won't say which ones.  Ashcroft also said investigators believe the arrests and detentions have thwarted terrorist plots since 19 hijackers flew passenger jets into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and crashed one in Pennsylvania.

Ghassan Dahduli, 41, a computer technician and father of five from suburban Dallas, was accompanied by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents on a flight to Jordan on Tuesday, said his Texas lawyer, Karen Pennington. Dahduli, who had been battling INS authorities over his status for more than a year, was arrested 11 days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  Although Dahduli has never been charged with any terrorist-related crime, he has acknowledged being friends in the 1980s with a close associate of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden.  Members of his family who were at the Amman airport to greet him Tuesday watched as he was escorted off the plane by INS agents and blue-suited Jordanian security men, Pennington said.  \"All this raises concerns in my mind about whether [U.S. officials] are there to supervise his interrogation by the Jordanians using methods impermissible under U.S. law,\" she said.  Messages left at the Jordanian Embassy here were not returned this week. Human rights groups said the Jordanians have tortured some suspected terrorists and provided their statements to U.S. officials.  U.S. government officials, while declining to comment on Dahduli, denied arranging the torture of anyone.  ',\n",
       " \"IMM-10945  PRIMARY  Va. Case a Window on Terror Probe  When federal authorities arrested Agus Budiman on immigration charges in late October, the Alexandria resident thought his attorney would be able to get him out of jail the next day.  The immigration problem was a minor one that he thought could easily be cleared up, he told his attorney.  But weeks later, he's still in jail. The FBI now has publicly linked him to at least two of the hijackers suspected of crashing jetliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field. He is also charged with identification document fraud -- a federal felony carrying up to 15 years in prison -- and he is being held without bond.  A food delivery driver for Takeout Taxi, Budiman, 31, in many ways is like hundreds of other people caught in the FBI dragnet in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. He is a Muslim immigrant who authorities believe has violated the letter of his visa. In addition, his answers to repeated questions about the terror attacks have so far not satisfied the FBI.  As Attorney General John D. Ashcroft increasingly is asked to explain the FBI's detention of Muslim immigrants, Budiman's case, which resumes today in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, is illustrative of how the system is treating many of the Sept. 11 detainees.  Before coming to the United States in October 2000 to live with a younger brother in Silver Spring, Budiman, an Indonesian citizen, lived in Germany, studying architecture in Hamburg from 1992 to 2000, according to court testimony and documents. There, Budiman attended the same mosque as Mohamed Atta, who was the leader of the terrorist attacks. He also got to know Marwan Al-Shehhi, who flew one of the planes into the World Trade Center, and Ramzi Binalshibh, another terrorist suspect, FBI agent Jesus Gomez testified Monday. Binalshibh has been named by the FBI as a would-be 20th hijacker.  \",\n",

Yes, I do,\" Ashcroft said at a news conference. He did not elaborate.  Immigration and Naturalization Service agents arrested Al-Najjar Saturday outside his Tampa apartment after a federal appeals court in Atlanta affirmed his deportation order on Nov. 13.  A Palestinian who overstayed a student visa, Al-Najjar was jailed for 3 1/2 years while he fought deportation because the government said classified intelligence information linked him to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a terrorist group.  He was released last year after a federal judge in Miami ruled his due process rights had been violated because the government would not reveal enough of the classified evidence to allow him to mount a defense.  The government is now working to secure his entry into the United Arab Emirates, the country where Al-Najjar last lived before entering the United States in 1981 and the country to which an immigration judge ordered him deported in 1997.  While it appears that Al-Najjar\\'s long-running battle to stay in the United States is nearing an end, his brother-in-law, Sami Al-Arian, suggested otherwise.  \"The way I read the rules, if the government decides to deport him anywhere other than the (United Arab) Emirates, he can challenge the decision, which could take another two years,\" Al-Arian said Monday. \"Even if it is the Emirates, he\\'ll have some avenues to challenge.\"  ',\n",
       " 'IMM-10968  PRIMARY  CLOSE THE RIGHT BORDER  The contorted state of U.S. immigration policy becomes more apparent with each disturbing detail investigators uncover about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The latest disclosure, that authorities believe all 19 hijackers entered the country legally, underscores the need for reform that sharpens the lines defining people the nation wants to come here and those it must keep out.  While the government handed visas to suicidal terrorists, millions of immigrants from Mexico and Latin America still carry the stigma of illegal status, though they work hard, fill unwanted jobs, pay taxes and make essential contributions to the U.S. economy. Three months ago, the Bush administration and Congress were discussing ways to grant residency to many of the nation\\'s estimated 8.5 million undocumented workers, most of them Mexicans. Public sentiment about immigration swung radically after the terrorist attacks, however, and lawmakers abandoned reforms, considering them too politically unsavory.  The Democratic leadership in Congress wants to return to the issue. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., visited Mexico two weeks ago and met with President Vicente Fox and parliament leaders. Sen. Daschle and Rep. Gephardt say they are committed to \"an earned legalization program,\" under which millions of Mexican immigrants could work their way toward legal status. The lawmakers correctly believe the government shouldn\\'t treat hard-working people who don\\'t have documents as if they are criminals, particularly since it has treated criminals as welcome guests.

       " 'IMM-1098  PRIMARY  DRASTIC IMMIGRATION CURBS HURT NATION  COMMENTARY COLUMN  The most extreme immigration legislation in the 200-year story of our republic is moving swiftly through Congress. HR 2202, approved by the House immigration subcommittee in July, is no less than a full-scale declaration of war against immigrants, their American family members and the American companies that employ them.  Unlike California Proposition 187, which at least confined itself to illegal immigration, HR 2202 would slash legal immigration as well - in cruel and foolish ways and by unprecedented amounts.  Public concern about large-scale illegal immigration is understandable. If sovereignty means anything at all, it surely means that a nation may decide whom to admit into its territory. Effective responses to illegal immigration are therefore essential; the status quo, most will agree, is not acceptable.  But legal immigration is another story. It has been not only the bedrock of our unique national identity but a key ingredient of our material success. Immigration is a core national value, ratified by two centuries of experience.  Unfortunately, the present political climate rewards elected officials for sounding \"tough on immigration.\" Both major parties know that California, Texas and Florida will be critical in the 1996 presidential race.  In such a climate, fine distinctions between legal and illegal immigrants are easily lost. That is regrettable, because comprehensive new admission criteria for immigrants went into effect just four years ago. Refinements are always possible, but a complete makeover is unnecessary. For one thing, the new system has barely been tested. For another, all early indications are that this component of our immigration policy is working well. As the saying goes, if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.  ',\n",

Abdul Abbass, an immigration inspector at Philadelphia International Airport, felt his heart sink Sept. 11. He knew the country might never be the same.  And neither would his job.  \"They could have walked right past me,\" Abbass said about the hijackers as he stood behind Booth No. 8 in the immigration inspection hall at the airport. \"If one of those guys had a visa, there\\'s nothing we could do. I feel like we haven\\'t done enough to control all these people. But we have limited powers.\"  Abbass is a soldier of sorts, posted on one of the new front lines of America\\'s war on terrorism. He is among about 4,800 Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors nationwide who in minutes must pick out would-be terrorists, and other undesirables, from hundreds of millions of ordinary travelers at more than 300 ports of entry, mostly airports.  Since the attacks, immigration officers at airports, border crossings and INS offices have been checking passports, scrutinizing visas, and ordering investigations and detentions with what some concede is greater anxiety and suspicion.  It\\'s a needle-in-a-haystack task, with a nervous nation watching over immigration officers\\' shoulders. Using a database that was proven inadequate by the Sept. 11 attacks, inspectors must depend more than ever on nuances and gut feelings about the strangers standing in front of them.  Abbass, 50, a native of Ghana who has been an INS inspector for about three years, said the number of people he sends back for more questioning in a secure area behind his booth is almost double what it was before Sept. 11.

Fourteen Mexicans live in the two apartments - Julio and six other men in one, an extended family in the other - on the top floor of the three-story building a few blocks south of Tower Grove Park.

Pilar Aceves, executive director of the Mexican Center of Atlanta, said she favors a license \"that says you can\\'t vote and can only use it for driving purposes.\"  The petition drive is significant because it will show \"that finally the Latino community has come together for a project,\" she said.  Rep. Bobby Parham (D-Milledgeville), chairman of the House Motor Vehicles Committee, said he has polled his committee several times and the bill does not have enough support.

The Justice Department asked local law enforcement agencies around the country for help tracking down 5,000 men for questioning about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But acting Police Chief Andrew Kirkland refused.  \"The law does not allow us to go out and arbitrarily interview people whose only offense is immigration or citizenship,\" he said Tuesday.

The board also debated whether the college should report foreign students who drop out or stop coming to class.  Trustees said they thought the new rules were necessary in light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Several of the terrorists implicated in the attacks had come to the United States on student visas and remained after their credentials expired.  \"We are the eyes and ears at the ground level,\" said trustee Judy Parker, who proposed the new rules. \"We need to tighten this up and get rid of the riffraff that drifts into our country.\"  Only 17 students are at PHCC studying on student visas. None of those students are using expired paperwork, college President Robert Judson said.  Judson said he had no problem reporting students who tried to enroll on expired visas but questioned whether the college had the authority to track and report on former students.

The political response this time has included not only the customary calls by right-wing conservatives for tough action, but an outcry from across the entire political spectrum, including self-styled progressives.  Debate has broken out in a number of cities over whether to expel foreigners who commit crimes, whether to group all illegal aliens in camps and whether to toughen border vigilance or even ban immigration outright. Even in Florence, a city that takes pride in its cosmopolitan atmosphere, a fierce political dispute has arisen over construction of camps for a relative handful of East European transients.  Such calls to curb immigration and control immigrants have long occupied right-wing political agendas, not only in Italy but in Germany, France and to some extent the United States -- all places where strains have grown between citizens and newcomers. In Italy, established leftist parties long ago dismissed concerns about the influx of foreigners as racist. That is now changing.  \"When one talks about immigration, there is a risk of touching an exposed nerve on the left,\" wrote Miriam Mafai, an old-line leftist intellectual and columnist, in a newspaper column last month. \"The problem is difficult, but it\\'s not a good idea to put it aside.\"  ',\n",

State troopers arrest criminals statewide and patrol highways to enforce motor-vehicle laws and regulations. Uniformed officers issue traffic citations to motorists who violate the law. At the scene of accidents, they may direct traffic, give first aid and call for emergency equipment. State troopers are often called upon to help other law-enforcement agencies. State law-enforcement agencies operate in every state except Hawaii. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are the government's principal investigators, responsible for investigating violations of more than 260 statutes and conducting sensitive national-security investigations. Agents may conduct surveillance, monitor court-authorized wiretaps, examine business records, investigate white-collar crime, track the interstate movement of stolen property, collect evidence of espionage activities or participate in sensitive undercover assignments. The FBI investigates organized crime, public corruption, financial crime, fraud against the government, bribery, copyright infringement, civil-rights violations, bank robbery, extortion, kidnapping, air piracy, terrorism, foreign counterintelligence, interstate criminal activity, drug trafficking and other violations of federal laws. Drug-Enforcement Administration agents enforce laws relating to illegal drugs. Not only is the DEA the lead agency for domestic enforcement of federal drug laws, it also has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations abroad. Agents may conduct complex criminal investigations, carry out surveillance of criminals and infiltrate illicit drug groups using undercover techniques. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents and inspectors facilitate the entry of legal visitors and immigrants to the United States and detain and deport those arriving illegally. They consist of border-patrol agents, immigration inspectors, criminal investigators and immigration agents as well as detention and deportation officers.  \",\n",

He also said he favored expanded guest worker programs and provisions for allowing relatives of legal Mexican workers to join them in the United States.  Daschle and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) are in Mexico talking about immigration, security and economic development at a time when Mexican immigration to the United States is dropping sharply.  Officials say far fewer Mexicans are moving to the United States, partly because there are fewer jobs in a slowing U.S. economy and partly because it\\'s more difficult to cross newly tightened U.S. borders. Apprehensions of illegal immigrants trying to enter the United States from Mexico from Oct. 1 through Nov. 5 dropped 54 percent from the same period last year.  ',\n",

But the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which pays the jail to house the detainees, said it was unaware of any hunger strikers. Nonetheless, the agency said it would take steps to address concerns of detainees at the jail, the Hudson County Correctional Center, including serving halal meals, which adhere to Islamic dietary rules, beginning today.  Jacob de Lemos, a county spokesman, said two of the seven detainees began refusing to take meals two weeks ago, and have been joined in a hunger strike by five others. He would not identify the detainees. The jail, in Kearny, N.J., about five miles west of Manhattan, was holding 303 immigration service detainees yesterday, most of them rounded up since the attacks, Mr. de Lemos said. \"They feel that the I.N.S. does not visit them enough at the jail or let them know what\\'s going on with their cases,\" he said.  Mr. de Lemos said the hunger strikers had been drinking fluids and were under medical observation in their cells, which are in a separate pod from the jail\\'s criminal defendants and convicts. He said it was unclear whether the detainees had lost any weight. \"They\\'re not taking the food that we\\'re giving them, but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re not eating, either,\" he said.  ',\n",

Other limits also apply.<  Hoping to crack down on the fraudulent use of driver\\'s licenses to prove legal residency, New Jersey has stopped issuing them to immigrants whose visas expire in a year or less.  The change, which took effect Wednesday, was prompted by a security review after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, officials at the state Division of Motor Vehicle Services said. Several of the 19 hijackers used fraudulently obtained driver\\'s licenses that helped them open bank accounts, buy airline tickets, and rent cars.  Two of them, ringleader Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Alomari, had New Jersey licenses. The FBI and New Jersey authorities would not say whether the licenses were fake or had been obtained fraudulently.  \"We have known for some time, as has every motor-vehicle agency in the country, that a driver\\'s license has a value beyond that of the driving privilege,\" said Dana Sullivan, a spokesman for the Division of Motor Vehicle Services. \"It\\'s used by most adults as a primary form of identification.  \"We have had some abuse of that, and we believe that there is some abuse on the part of people who are in this country on temporary visas and present a driver\\'s license as proof of their permanent residence.

Attorney General John Ashcroft said the Immigration and Naturalization Service would be split into two bureaus to streamline its border enforcement and service duties.  Spanish police, who dismantled a radical recruitment cell this week linked to al-Qaida, said they were searching for another three Islamic militants who appeared in a video seized in police raids.  The FBI believes a Yemeni citizen who is the focus of a worldwide manhunt was supposed to have been the 20th hijacker on Sept. 11 but failed to get into the United States. Earlier, the government had suggested a man arrested in Minnesota, Zacarias Moussaoui, was the 20th hijacker.  FBI raids on the homes of three Chester, Pa., city officials of Pakistani descent appear to have turned up little of significance, officials said.  More than $56 million in financial assets linked to al-Qaida and the Taliban have been blocked worldwide since Sept. 11, the Treasury Department said.  ',\n",
       " 'IMM-1106  PRIMARY  Legal entry is targeted for limits  There are few hotter issues than immigration on Capitol Hill, on the campaign trail, and in communities around the country.  What began several years ago as a debate over illegal immigration has broadened to take aim at a new target: legal immigration.  Congress appears inclined to move toward sharp cuts in the number of legal immigrants and refugees allowed into the United States every year. Other legislation under consideration would prohibit immigrants from bringing siblings and adult children into the country.  - STATUS OF LEGISLATION: The House Judiciary Committee is currently considering immigration issues. On Thursday it agreed that foreigners fleeing persecution in their homelands would have no more than 30 days to apply for asylum in the United States. Current law does not set an application deadline for foreigners who ask for permission to stay after setting foot on U.S. soil.  That change is part of the broader bill to reduce immigration, written by Rep . Lamar Smith (R-Texas). Democrats have repeatedly questioned the need to restrict legal immigration, but most of their attempts to soften the bill have failed. A majority of the committee\\'s members, including Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, are Republicans.  More than a dozen proposed amendments remain to be considered as the committee made plans to continue debate for a seventh day today.  \"We are making Judge Lance Ito look expeditious,\" said committee Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), referring to the judge who presided during the nine-month O.J. Simpson trial.  ',\n",

A senior administration official said that any such trials would \"not necessarily\" be public and that the American tribunals might operate in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  At the same time, the Justice Department has asked law enforcement authorities across the country to pick up and question 5,000 men, most from Middle Eastern countries, who entered the country legally in the last two years.  Both actions are part of a sweeping government effort to expand the investigation into Al Qaeda\\'s network and clear the way for the more aggressive prosecution of anyone charged with terrorism.  Mr. Bush signed the order allowing for the military tribunals shortly before leaving this afternoon for his ranch in Crawford, Tex. White House officials said the order did not create a military tribunal or a list of terrorists to be tried. Instead, they said, it was an \"option\" that the president would have should Osama bin Laden or his associates in Al Qaeda be captured. If the tribunals were created, it would be the first time since World War II that such an approach was used, officials said.  Under the order, the president himself is to determine who is an accused terrorist and therefore subject to trial by the tribunal. The order states that the president may \"determine from time to time in writing that there is reason to believe\" that an individual is a member of Al Qaeda, has engaged in acts of international terrorism or has \"knowingly harbored\" a terrorist.

The additional background check means that the applicants, from 25 countries, must wait as long as four extra weeks to obtain tourist, student or business visas. The temporary measure is a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, which allegedly were carried out by 19 Middle Eastern men.  In a separate announcement, the Justice Department said it will seek to question more than 5,000 young men who have come to the United States as visitors or students since January 2000 from countries where terrorist groups such as Osama bin Laden\\'s al Qaeda network are active.  Civil rights and Arab American groups expressed concern over both measures, the latest in a series of controversial tactics the government has adopted as it tries to locate and deter future terrorists.  \"My concern is, what will this look like in practice? The government has the right to scrutinize people who come to this country, but it shouldn\\'t discriminate against them,\" said Hussein Ibish, spokesman for the American Arab Anti-discrimination Committee.  The extra screening was a highly unusual step, imposed under pressure from the Justice Department, officials said. The State Department, which issues visas through U.S. consulates, has generally restricted such scrutiny to a few countries considered sponsors of terrorism.  ',\n",

They ate fast food for lunch, downed cold beers at quitting time and went home to a dingy apartment in Jersey City.  Like many other immigrants they sent money home, to India.  Then, a day after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Ayub Ali Khan ended up in Texas, having traveled nearly 1,600 miles in two days by airliner and train. Their luggage contained $5,600, an assortment of passports and box-cutting knives similar to those believed to have been the terrorist hijackers\\' weapon of choice.  When confronted by police looking for drug couriers, they appeared nervous. Azmath volunteered: \"I did not have anything to do with New York.\"  Their story is one of the most intriguing and perplexing to come out of worldwide investigation of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.  They remain in federal custody, held as material witnesses but not charged with any crime.  Officials familiar with the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, have repeatedly placed Azmath and Khan among a handful of people who are under the most intense scrutiny but are not cooperating with investigators.  Authorities have not disclosed any information that would connect the two to the hijackings, although the FBI acknowledges receiving reports that suspected hijack ringleaders Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi were seen last summer in the neighborhood where Khan and Azmath lived.

With 80 percent of the vote counted, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Mr. Howard\\'s Liberal Party had won 67 seats in the 150-seat lower house of Parliament. Its junior coalition partner, the National Party, won 12 seats, giving them a majority. The rival Labor Party, led by Kim Beazley, 52, a former defense minister, won 65 seats, the network reported.

Mr. Beazley, who has led his party for six years, conceded defeat and withdrew from the leadership, saying, \"We fought in the adverse circumstances of the fog of war.\"  The re-election of the Howard government will consolidate Australia\\'s cordial official links with the United States. \"All of us are deeply conscious of the changes that have come over the world and therefore over our nation since the terrible events in the United States of Sept. 11,\" Mr. Howard said.

The 25 immigrants were being transferred to the Union County Jail after an uprising at a privately run detention center nearby. As their van arrived, prosecutors said, jail guards formed a gantlet to punch and kick them.  Over the next four hours, the prosecutors said, the guards broke one detainee\\'s collarbone, shoved other detainees\\' heads in toilets, used pliers to pull out one man\\'s pubic hair and forced a line of men to kneel naked on the jail floor and chant, \"America is No. 1.\"  Prosecutors said that at least two dozen officers participated in the beatings and that more arrests were likely.  An attorney for the arrested officers denied the charges, saying the detainees had fabricated their accounts.  Joyce Antila Phipps, a lawyer for six of the immigrants, said the men were \"shocked and appalled\" by the guards\\' actions. In America, she said, \"they never expected the type of treatment they received from the police in their home countries.\"  The 25 detainees sent to the Union County Jail were among 315 people awaiting immigration hearings who had been held at the Immigration and Naturalization Service center in Elizabeth. After the June 18 disturbance, which caused considerable property damage but no serious injuries to guards, an I.N.S. investigation concluded that the detainees acted because of abusive and inhumane conditions at the center, which has been closed.

One criminal who failed to show up was later convicted of raping a child, the Justice Department inspector general reported.  The internal report faulted Immigration and Naturalization Service officials for failing to locate questionable foreigners who skipped the interviews.  \"We found that the INS took little or no follow-up action on the no-shows,\" the report says. It says that \"individuals who do not appear for their inspection do so with virtual impunity.\"  The vast majority of the 75 million people who pass through airport inspections are admitted after an initial screening with immigration officials.  Those with immigration problems or criminal backgrounds are turned over to a second inspector who decides whether the foreigner should be turned away or allowed to enter with a chance to clear up problems at a follow-up inspection at an INS district office.  The government has cracked down on immigration policies since the suicide hijackings of Sept. 11. INS officials said Tuesday that inspectors were being more careful about deferring interviews.  The agency agreed to carry out the report\\'s recommendations that it fingerprint foreigners and hold on to travel documents for those with criminal backgrounds who were admitted pending inspections.

       " 'IMM-11109  PRIMARY  Keeping terrorists out  The Bush administration and members of Congress have come up with some common-sense measures to make it more difficult for foreign terrorists to enter the country. The measures include tightening borders, scrutinizing visa applicants, sharing national security information among U.S. agencies and keeping better track of foreign visitors while they are here. The task ahead, however, will be difficult and expensive.  \"The best way of protecting the United States is to keep these (terrorists) out,\" said Mary Ryan, assistant secretary of state for consular affairs. True, it would be difficult to launch violent assaults on American soil without having agents in the country. But consider the magnitude of the challenge: In 2000, 50-million foreign travelers visited the United States.  In the past, little attention was given to most visa applications. Of the 19 terrorists who hijacked airplanes on Sept. 11, 15 entered the country legally. That would change under new rules announced by Attorney General John Ashcroft. Members and supporters of 46 terrorist organizations recognized by the federal government would not be eligible for entry into the United States, and all visa applicantions would get closer scrutiny.  For the security checks to be meaningful, government agencies will have to organize and share their intelligence information. Ashcroft has created a task force to track foreign terrorists, and one of its main goals is to get the FBI, Immigration and Naturalization Service and Customs Service to share information they have gathered about terrorism. Two Senate bills have been filed to require the CIA to share its information on suspected terrorists with offices responsible for issuing visas.  ',\n",

More than 1-million legal immigrants and more than 300,000 illegals enter the United States every year. There is no way that immigration officials can properly screen this mass influx.  It\\'s high time that members of Congress realize that legal immigration should be cut back, and illegal immigration should be brought to a screeching halt. In view of the Sept. 11 cowardly attack on this nation, it should be very clear that identity and background checks of immigrants be of the highest priority. There is no way that this can be successfully done unless we cut back on the mass exodus from other countries to our own.  Equally important is for Congress to pass \"English only\" legislation. If our government continues in its taxpayer-financed promotion of multiculturalism, it could destroy what has kept us together as a diverse, but unified, nation - our English language. Foreigners who leave their own countries to settle in the United States obviously must think that their lives in this country will be better than in their native lands. Therefore, they should be willing to learn English, embrace our customs and our way of life.

Legislation, now on its way to the Senate, would give President Bush a platform to tout his pro-immigration credentials when he meets with Mexican President Vicente Fox next week.  But in an effort to avoid the rush to the altar that swept the country when the same program was in effect last year, the bill requires immigrants to prove they were married or sponsored by a U.S. employer before Aug. 15, 2001, in order to qualify.  An estimated 200,000 immigrants who failed to apply for residency when the four-month program was in effect early last year might benefit from the new measure.  But others fear that the August deadline would exclude thousands of immigrants who tied the knot with a U.S. citizen after that date or didn\\'t seek sponsorship from their employers because there was no program in place at the time.  \"People are hoping against hope that this will be an answer to their prayers, and it won\\'t for a lot of people,\" said Doug Keegan of the Santa Cruz County Immigration Project.

The inspectors must check the documents of each foreigner to try to keep out terrorists, smugglers and other criminals who would harm the country.  But they also must follow the 45-minute rule. Inspectors have that long to clear all the passengers of an arriving flight, under a federal law passed at the urging of the travel industry.  Bipartisan border security legislation, which once appeared to be on a fast track, would do away with that time limit.  The far-reaching measure, drafted jointly by lawmakers from both the House and Senate in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, also would require installing machines at ports and border crossings to record each foreign visitor\\'s entry and exit. And it would mandate more tamper-resistant travel documents and stricter monitoring for foreign students.  The bill passed the House on a voice vote late last year and came within an inch of immediate Senate approval, until it was halted by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.).

The bill would allow noncitizens meeting certain criteria to remain in the country while applying for permanent residency. It set a November deadline for the application window. Under current law, immigrants can only apply for and receive visas and immigration papers from U.S embassies in their home countries.  The House legislation would cover only those applicants who were in the United States before Dec. 21, 2000, and who had a work sponsor or an eligible family relationship, such as a spouse or a child who was a citizen or permanent resident prior to Aug. 14, 2001.  Advocates for the bill say it would help keep families together and eliminate a bureaucratic hurdle that keeps a small group of qualified immigrants from having paperwork processed in a timely manner. Opponents say it would encourage illegal immigration and increase the potential for terrorist attacks.  Triangle Democrats Rep. David Price, 4th District, and Rep.

None of the other hijackers on the planes that hit the towers was known to have had pilot training.  For several months in 2000, Atta and al-Shehhi were student pilots at Huffman Aviation, a flight school in Venice, 60 miles south of the Tampa Bay area.

The legislation would allow undocumented people to  receive legal standing by being able to apply for valid green cards.  Undocumented people who qualify would have to have been in  the United States by a certain date, have filed a declaration with  the INS, have an approved sponsor and pay a $ 1,000 penalty.  While the exact terms have not yet been worked out, an  amnesty-extension bill appears to once again start the dialogue  between Mexico and the United States about undocumented workers in  this county. Creating some type of law to help undocumented  workers in the United States was a Bush priority, but it fell by the wayside following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Bush's  agreement with the House leadership is expected to result in a  quick passage in the House. The Senate is expected to be favorable  to the bill as well.  \",\n",

They said Luis Lopez, 47, and his family had traveled to Cuba on Feb. 23, but their traveling documents were seized by Cuban immigration officials on March 1, after it was discovered that some of their relatives had recently fled Cuba for the United States. This afternoon, after lobbying by American officials in Cuba, the family was given back their documents. They plan to leave Cuba on Saturday, according to Debra DeShong, a spokeswoman for Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who intervened on behalf of Mr. Lopez; his mother, Aida, 69; his wife, Mireya, 43; and their daughter, Vanessa, 6.  Most of the official lobbying, by the United States Interests Section, the State Department's official presence in Havana, was done on behalf of Vanessa Lopez, who is a United States citizen. The other members of the Lopez family, who live in Cliffside Park, legally immigrated to the United States 14 years ago, but are still Cuban citizens.  Some officials and family members characterized the little girl as a kind of reverse Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy who survived a treacherous ocean crossing to Florida two years ago, before being returned to Cuba in the wake of demands by his father and officials there.  \",\n",

The lawyers cite a decision from U.S. Magistrate Judge Arthur Boylan in Minneapolis, who recommended barring the deportation of Keyse G. Jama, a Somali native convicted of assault in Hennepin County, \"until the government of the country to which he is to be removed has agreed to accept him.\"  The decision came Feb. 1. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service deported the 10 Somalis from Minnesota, and 20 others from across the United States and Canada, less than two weeks later.  One of those deported is married to Sara O\\'Keefe of Cannon Falls, Minn., a nursing student caring for their 22-month-old daughter.  She and her husband, 21-year-old Habib Ibrahim, knew deportation was a risk because of his 1998 burglary conviction in Steele County, but they figured it unlikely to happen until order had been restored in Somalia. Ibrahim was born there but fled the war-torn country when he was 11, has no friends or family there and barely speaks the language.  \"We had never had an actual discussion about it because it was too hard of a topic,\" O\\'Keefe said of the prospects for her husband\\'s deportation. \"Obviously, I can\\'t choose to go live where it\\'s violence and poverty.\"  ',\n",

If approved, the plan would affect untold numbers of Defense Department staffers working on \"sensitive but unclassified\" projects as well as legions of workers at technology firms with contracts to maintain agency databases or revamp military e-mail systems.

The agency is not certain how many of its own employees would be affected or what the potential cost would be. The U.S. Navy is studying the scope of the proposal, the spokesman said.  The text of the proposed rule has not been released publicly. It comes in the wake of increasing concern about national security after last year\\'s terrorist attacks.

New Jersey is home to hundreds of immigrants who were taken into custody after the attacks, and this lawsuit is the second over the detentions filed by the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union -- this time on behalf of two newspapers seeking to attend the hearings.

He pledged more and better detection devices and other security-enhancing innovations on the U.S. side, saying: \"Our technological approach to the border is really outdated.\"  President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox will sign a border security-improvement agreement March 22, Ridge said, when they meet in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey.  Mexican border authorities had no immediate comment on Ridge\\'s views on the state of border security.  The porous U.S. border with Mexico has long been an open door to drug traffickers and to coyotes, who smuggle illegal immigrants into the United States. The majority of those smuggled are Mexican nationals, but in recent years the activity has expanded to include people of many nationalities.  Initial reports that some Sept. 11 terrorists had entered the United States via Mexico proved false, but the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon intensified U.S. concern about its borders. The United States and Canada have signed a border security-improvement measure.  One precondition of both deals is that tighter border security not interfere with commerce.

And lawyers hoping to represent many others went to court to force the government to release their names.  Frustrated by the unprecedented secrecy in which the government has cloaked its detention of people arrested for questioning after the Sept. 11 attacks, lawyers for the detainees are using a variety of legal tactics - some of them novel - to try to chip away at the official silence surrounding the cases.  \"Here, you\\'re first guilty. Then, after a few months, you become a suspect. Then, finally, you\\'re innocent,\" said Regis Fernandez, a Newark immigration lawyer representing several detainees.  Fernandez and several other immigration lawyers met last fall to plan a counterattack against secrecy directives that were rendering attorneys and advocates for detainees virtually powerless.  \"We were relegated to making telephone calls to find out where our clients were and whether they\\'d been cleared,\" he said. \"So we did just what the government is doing in these cases: we shared information and strategized and agreed to work together.

Even as the two Republican candidates sought to appeal to Cuban-Americans, White House policy makers predicted that many Cuban immigrants would support the policy because it would ease the suffering of the Cuban people.  Administration officials said Cuban-Americans would be pleased that the President\\'s new policy would make it easier for them to visit sick relatives in Cuba and finance human rights organizations there.  The new policy would also allow Cuban-Americans to send money to relatives who are suffering from disaster and would permit a greater flow of students, professors, artists and members of the clergy between the United States and Cuba.

The verdict: A passionate, warmhearted depiction of the immigrant experience.  Among contemporary writers from India, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni fills a space all her own. Minus the fiery ego of a Salman Rushdie or the cool rationality of a Jhumpa Lahiri, her fiction draws a line straight to the heart. Her depictions of the immigrant experience employ Hindu myths and the legacy of her homeland with a conviction not found among her most celebrated peers.  In her new novel, \"The Vine of Desire,\" Divakaruni continues the story of the two women linked by fate and friendship in her earlier book, the best-selling \"Sister of My Heart.\" Where the earlier book was set almost entirely in India, however, the sequel is centered in America. This is a critical element because the story deals with what can happen when old customs and structures fall away.  The plot revolves around three characters, the \"heart sisters\" Anju and Sudha and Anju\\'s husband, Sunil. The action explodes onto the stage with a harrowing description of Anju\\'s late-stage miscarriage --- the event that triggers the rest of the book, as Anju is left grief-stricken in San Francisco and cries out across two continents for Sudha.

Congratulations to Richard Lamm and Ricardo Pimentel on their  excellent articles on immigration.

Does their experience cause them to bond with their new country  - or does it have the potential to turn them into future  terrorists?  The United States, for all its flaws, does an extraordinary job  of allowing immigrants to prosper and to develop a stake in the  success of this country. That isn't true in Europe, and that  continent's lack of opportunity is a source of danger for us. Let  me give two examples.  Angel is a housepainter from Ecuador who has been living in  Barcelona, Spain, for about eight years. He does excellent work  but can't start his own business and has to find work through a  Spanish middleman.

But even with a two-week postponement of the deadline to March 8, some groups believe that logistically it is still too difficult to contact the tens of thousands of people in Lower Manhattan who have not applied. As a result, some groups said yesterday that they still thought the deadline was arbitrary and hasty, and therefore should be waived altogether.  Together, the three charities -- the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Safe Horizon -- have disbursed more than $250 million in emergency assistance to 50,000 displaced workers and other individuals who lost income because of the attack. And on Feb. 8, the charities established a Feb. 22 cutoff date for applicants to make appointments, saying that it was time to shift attention from emergency assistance to long-term help.  On Thursday, though, the charities decided to postpone the deadline, in part because of concerns that some people were still unaware of the deadlines, or even of the programs. And yesterday, the Sept. 11 Fund -- which has been the primary source of money for Safe Horizon and has provided another $70 million in assistance to displaced workers -- held a press conference to reach out to the ethnic press and emphasize that noncitizens, too, are eligible for assistance, regardless of their status.

The move came in the wake of disclosures that 13 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers easily acquired Florida driver licenses or ID cards by submitting immigration documents that the state never tried to check or that were unverifiable. Long after the terrorists' temporary visas expired, the six-year driver licenses remained valid, aiding their ability to move freely throughout the country.  Gov. Bush and the Legislature reacted by putting new restrictions on foreigners. The governor used an executive order to require background checks on all driver-license applicants who are not American or Canadian citizens. The change required license examiners to give foreigners 30-day permits while their papers are being checked. Foreigners who clear the checks receive licenses that are valid only until their visas expire. Legislators gave the Florida Department of Highways and Motor Vehicles $500,000 for scanning equipment to copy the foreigners' documents.  The system has been in place less than two months, and its central flaw appears catastrophic: The state's DMV employees routinely find themselves cast as federal Immigration and Naturalization Service workers, and they haven't the training, experience or resources to do the job.

'Fixing' immigration is just more politically pleasing to  frightened ears and feeds the need to do something, anything.  Close the border? This is simply mission impossible. Or, as a  politician I recently interviewed asked, how can we seal the  border if we can't even keep drugs out of maximum-security prisons?  The milder version of this scapegoating suffers because the  tightening has the potential of doing damage to our treasured  value of openness and to people who have about as much chance of  becoming terrorists as Osama bin Laden has of winning the Nobel  Peace Prize.  On the surface, some proposals appear to be just plain common  sense. Unfortunately, they also offer a false sense of security.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-11323  PRIMARY  For Guyanese Sisters, A Dream Takes Flight; With One Plane, Immigrants Launch an Airline  This immigrant-rich city harbors many dreamers: the Korean family that scrapes to buy a dry cleaning store, the Sikh family that strives to buy a yellow taxi, the Bangladeshis who lease their own newsstands.  And then there are the Guyanese sisters who launched their own airline.  In December, Chandramatie Harpaul and Ramashree Singh opened Universal Airlines, an international carrier whose fleet consists of a single Boeing 767-300 jet painted with the multicolored flags of their native Guyana. They lease the airplane from LOT Polish Airlines, and a Polish flight crew -- none of whom speak too much English -- flies it five times a week between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Georgetown, Guyana, on the Caribbean coast of South America.  This is a Guyanese-specific airline. The flights leave after midnight so that immigrant travelers can work all day, board the airplane and arrive at dawn, saving a hotel stay. The operators charge bulk rates for unlimited baggage so that immigrants can stock up on gifts of all sizes for their families. And flight attendants serve Guyanese foods like roti and curry.  The sisters' goal isn't so much to beat their two competitors on the route -- BWIA West Indies Airways and North American Airlines, which fly to many more Caribbean cities -- as to carve out and maintain their own milk run. The opportunity arose when their homeland's former airline, Guyana Airlines 2000, folded last year.  \",\n",

The I.N.S. has said it is holding 460 such people nationwide, with two of the largest clusters in Hudson and Passaic Counties, in New Jersey. Many are Arabs or Muslims who were picked up for questioning on immigration violations and are awaiting deportation.  Jail officials have let personal lawyers, family members and friends visit some of the detainees. But they had not previously given access to an array of civil rights groups, some of which have filed suits to try to penetrate the secrecy surrounding the detentions.  \"Generally, we were pleased that the I.N.S. allowed us to visit,\" said Allyson Collins, an associate director at Human Rights Watch in Washington.  Representatives of the groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International USA, visited the Hudson and Passaic County jails on Wednesday. Immigration officials in Newark took journalists on a tour of the Hudson County jail yesterday but would not allow interviews with any detainees.  The civil rights advocates described conditions at the Hudson County jail, a six-story concrete block building, as reasonably good. They said they were shown only small parts of the Passaic jail.  The Hudson County jail\\'s director, Ralph Green, told reporters that the detainees lived apart from inmates held on state criminal charges, though the two groups attend prayer services and educational classes together.

But the government said it had made no change in its policy of detaining illegal immigrants while their visa applications were processed, sometimes for years, and protests and hunger strikes continued at some of the country\\'s other immigration detention centers.  About 100 immigrants at a camp called Curtin in western Australia refused to eat for a third day, the government said. Detainees at another western Australian camp, Port Hedland center, are also refusing to eat or drink, according to reports.  Whether the tentative peace brokered with Afghan asylum seekers at Woomera, in the desert plains of South Australia, will last depends on continued discussions with representatives of the government\\'s advisory group on detention, a spokesman for the immigrants said.  \"The hunger strike ends, but it doesn\\'t mean that the negotiations will be finished,\" said the spokesman, Hassan Varasi. Members of the advisory group, he said, \"promised us that the dialogue, negotiation will continue.\"  The asylum seekers at Woomera, largely from the Middle East, have said their chief demand is to be moved out of mandatory detention.  The Australian government uses a network of detention centers to hold unauthorized immigrants while their cases are processed, and immigration officials insisted that no policy changes had been made to end the hunger strike at Woomera.

Arsalan Rizvi, 27, entered the plea in U.S. District Court in  Denver. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 6.  Prosecutor Gregory Goldberg told Judge Walker Miller that the  government would seek only probation with the provision that Rizvi  be deported immediately, which the Immigration and Naturalization  Service already has ordered. Rizvi has been held in solitary  confinement at the federal detention facility in Jefferson County  since his Oct. 31 arrest.  Rizvi's younger brother, Armoghan Rizvi, 23, was arrested by  the INS outside the federal courthouse in Denver while using a  cellphone during his brother's arraignment in November. Charged  with being an undocumented immigrant, Armoghan is expected to  plead guilty on Feb. 11.  'This is a witch hunt,' said Arsalan Rizvi's immigration  lawyer, Jim Salvator. 'It's scary what the government gets away  with when it decides to focus on someone.'  Salvator said Arsalan Rizvi's ex-wife telephoned Broomfield  police from somewhere in the Midwest several weeks after Sept. 11  and said he had abused her. Police arrested him on suspicion of  domestic violence and assault, and found a 12-gauge shotgun and  325 rounds of ammunition.

The threats have prompted a government delegation to make its third visit in about a week to the isolated camp, on the desert plains of South Australia, to discuss the immigrants\\' demands.  The immigrants are protesting the conditions at the camp, called Woomera, and the government\\'s policy of detaining all illegal immigrants while their applications for asylum wind through the bureaucracy, which can take years. In the past week, detainees at other centers across Australia have joined the protests.  Some have sewn their mouths shut and refused to eat. Others have harmed themselves by swallowing chemicals or cutting their wrists and stomachs. Several have tried to hang themselves, the government has confirmed.

An unfamiliar voice told them that their daughter, Gao Liqin, had been kidnapped from her home in Corona, Queens, and that if the family did not pay $38,800 she would be killed. The Gaos are still haunted by the memory of their daughter, a shy, 38-year-old seamstress, crying into the phone for a moment, begging them to cooperate, before the kidnapper came back on the line.  \"Get the money ready in six minutes,\" he said. Then he hung up.  The Gaos panicked. They still owed moneylenders $30,000 for sending their daughter to the United States a year ago, and did not see how they could borrow more. Over several subsequent phone calls, Mr. Gao, a day laborer, pleaded for the ransom to be reduced as his family wrestled with the chilling realization that they simply could not raise that kind of money quickly, if at all.  By the end, the authorities said, the kidnappers had raped Ms. Gao, cut off one of her fingers, hit her over the head with a television set and finally strangled her with a telephone cord on Sept. 2.  Even though the family says it paid $5,000 three days before her death in an apartment in Midwood, Brooklyn, the kidnappers killed Ms. Gao, apparently because they sensed that the police were closing in on them.

Finally, on Dec. 9, they arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam, from their Suffolk County home in East Quogue and were handed the baby they had decided to name Gabriel.  But in the weeks that followed, something went wrong. Instead of receiving a visa from the State Department that was required to bring Gabriel back to America, the couple got a thick packet at their hotel in early January from the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, informing them that no visa would be forthcoming, at least for now.  It turned out the Vietnamese agency that was helping out with the adoption was being investigated by the I.N.S. Seven other couples who had adopted children through the same agency were also left in the lurch. They were the legal parents of a child they fell in love with when they first saw his picture, but they could not bring him home.  \"You can imagine being only days away from being flown back to the United States and being told, \\'No, you can\\'t be a parent in your own country,\\' \" Ms. Kombrink said. \"I can\\'t tell you the heartbreak and the anger at hearing that terrible news.\"  ',\n",

If Census Bureau figures are to be believed, America is swarming with undocumented Brits and Germans, French and Italians, Russians and Polish.  \"Send the Europeans back,\" though, has not exactly become a battle cry for those anti-immigrant groups always so outraged by illegal immigration. The question is why.  Come to think of it, when those \"patriots\" talk about illegal immigrants, what they mean is Latinos, Asians, Africans - You know the deal.  Sure, there are millions of undocumented Mexicans and other Latin Americans. Everybody knows that.  The surprise is that there are also lots and lots of illegals from all those countries that aren\\'t normally thought of as sources of undocumented immigrants.

Yet, no outraged so-called patriot is known to have demanded, \"Ship the British back to where they came from,\" or to have called for stricter U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service scrutiny.

A computer network to track foreign students in the country, originally ordered by Congress six years ago, is still being tested and will not be running fully until next year. Even then, immigration service officials said, there will not be enough enforcement agents to check on all of the visa violators flagged by the system.  Moreover, colleges that see foreign students as a lucrative market are raising concerns about how the system will be paid for and operated, and their objections could delay it even further. Officials concede they do not know for sure where the 547,000 people holding student visas are attending school, or whether they actually are.  The halting efforts to plug the student visa system reflect the overall difficulty of improving domestic defense, most notably airline security. Even in a world said to be forever changed by terrorism, demands for better security are, just four months after the attacks, hitting an old reality of competing interests, entrenched lobbies and reluctance to make financial or practical sacrifices.  \"As we get further and further from Sept. 11, there has been kind of a resumption of the traditional battle lines,\" said Representative Anthony Weiner, Democrat of New York.

Arriving passengers also have been held on their planes or on the airport\\'s mobile lounges until the crowded immigration area cleared out.

U.S. companies and other groups applied for 342,035 H-1B work visas last year, up 14 percent from 2000, when the country\\'s economy was strong. About 163,200 H-1B visas were actually granted last year, up more than 40 percent, after Congress, under pressure from the technology industry, raised the cap on the number of visas the Immigration and Naturalization Service can issue.  At least 29,000 more visas are pending.  \"I think it surprised everyone,\" said Mark Shevitz, a vice president at Chicago-based VisaNow.com, a company that processes visas for clients and that studied the increase. \"All you hear about in the media is these huge layoffs and the tech industry is just shedding workers.\"  The H-1B is a six-year visa used for bringing in skilled foreign workers in sectors where there are supposed to be shortages of qualified U.S. ones. The program is a political hot potato and last year\\'s increases, which seem counterintuitive, are sure to fuel the ongoing debate about the controversial program.

A federal magistrate told them to get ready for a February 2003 trial.  Tyson attorney Mark Hobson said a trial would not support prosecutors\\' contentions of a company conspiracy, but instead would show immigrant smuggling by government undercover agents.  \"The case stems from a three-year undercover sting operation that, we believe, resulted in the employment of approximately 50 undocumented workers delivered by government agents to fewer than five Tyson facilities,\" the Arkansas-based company said in a statement.

Critics of the new law counter that foreigners should have the right of free political expression, so long as they are not participating in violent or illegal acts.  \"The new law gives the government a great deal of power to go after people on the basis of their political beliefs and associations,\" American Civil Liberties Union legislative counsel Tim Edgar said. \"I think the courts are going to have to decide on that.\"  Edgars said his group is monitoring the Justice Department\\'s use of the new anti-terrorism law. \"If the government goes too far, we would certainly challenge it,\" he said.

Nearly half these immigrants arrived from Mexico, lured by a then-strong economy and plentiful jobs. But since the 2000 census was taken, much has changed for many of the roughly 8.7 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Some lost their jobs and returned to their native countries.  And after the Sept. 11 attacks, the focus has shifted even more to closing immigration loopholes and tightening border patrols amid greater suspicion of foreigners.  For instance, the Justice Department has targeted for deportation thousands of men from countries - many in the Middle East - where Osama bin Laden\\'s al-Qaeda network operates.  Preliminary estimates from the 2000 census show that 115,000 people from Middle Eastern countries live in the United States illegally, or in \"quasi-legal\" status - refugees or political-asylum seekers.  While the vast majority of Middle Eastern immigrants are not terrorists, \"the fact that tens of thousands of people from that region and millions more from the rest of the world can settle in the United States illegally means that terrorists who wish to [enter the United States] face few obstacles,\" said Steven Camarota, research director at the nonpartisan Center for Immigration Studies.

On Jan. 10, the Bush administration proposed to restore food stamps to legal immigrants whose benefits eligibility was restricted by the 1996 welfare reform law. That law made low-income noncitizens ineligible for food stamps and other federally funded assistance, though some exemptions for immigrants remained in existence.  About 363,000 people --- legal immigrants but noncitizens --- would qualify under the plan. Most would be Hispanics, but they would have to have lived here legally for five years.  The proposal will be part of Bush\\'s 2003 budget to Congress next month. It will cost the federal government $2.1 billion over 10 years, and at least some version of it is expected to become law.

One Twin Cities Somali resident said the movie portrays Somalis as \"savage and pitiless beasts.\"  Leaders of Somali assistance agencies in the Twin Cities, home to the country\\'s largest concentration of refugees from the East African country, fear the film will harm efforts to build links between Somalis who have resettled here and the metro area\\'s larger population.  Somalis say they hope American audiences will realize that the people who have resettled here -- refugees from the trauma and torture of their country\\'s decade-long civil war -- have more in common with the U.S. troops who came under heavy fire during the operation than with the militiamen the film shows shooting, seemingly from every rooftop and window of the Somali capital.  The film arrives at a sensitive time for Somali immigrants. Before Sept. 11, many struggled to find jobs and housing. Since the terrorist attacks, they have had to face new worries, from scrutiny by federal agents questioning recent immigrants to raids that closed five Somali-run money-transfer agencies in Minneapolis.  Authorities alleged the agencies, which immigrants use to send money to relatives in refugee camps, had ties to an international network supporting terrorists.  ',\n",

LOUIS-AREA BUSINESSMAN WINS FREEDOM WHILE FIGHTING DEPORTATION; APPEALS COURT RULING ALLOWS INDIA NATIVE TO BE RELEASED ON BOND  At 4:19 p.m. Wednesday, more than a year after finishing a five-month sentence for hiring an illegal alien, Vinodbhai \"Jim\" Patel walked out the chain-link, razor-wire-trimmed gate of York County Prison - and into the embrace of his brother, cousins and wife.  \"I got my freedom back!\" the 55-year-old Creve Coeur businessman said as tears spilled from his eyes.  Freedom came at the price of a $50,000 bond. It was set Monday by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service - and posted Wednesday by V inod Patel, 33, his brother and business partner in a chain of St. Louis-area doughnut shops, bagel shops and hotels. The bond is hefty for a \"criminal alien,\" the INS term for Jim Patel, a native of India who has lived for 17 years in the United States.  That bond was set at all was unusual. A 1996 immigration law requires mandatory detention of most criminal aliens - without a chance for bond - while they await deportation, in some cases for years. In Patel\\'s case, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled last month that the law is unconstitutional for people like Patel because they are contesting their deportation.  It\\'s an issue expected to spark an INS appeal to the Supreme Court. A source at the Justice Department, which oversees the INS, said \"the matter is under review.\"  \"God bless America!\" Patel said, in between the trio of kisses he gave to the asphalt of the prison parking lot, where his family\\'s Chevy Astrovan awaited the 14-hour drive home.

It's midday and very quiet in this half-industrial corner of DeKalb County. The children are at school or asleep upstairs.  Several women gather in the small living room, their hands in the laps, pulling at their fingers, smiling or staring gloomily. The house looks rather neat for such a crowded place. But it must be hard to stop the kids from using their crayons on the walls.  A woman tells how she got there --- a tale of tragedy offstage. A knifing, perhaps. Or maybe a husband smashed a child's head against the wall.  Now the women are safe, though. So are the children. And the staff here speaks each woman's language, Spanish or Arabic or Hindi or whatever. Soon the other young women add their bits, speaking the simple sorrows that choruses are meant to speak.  But when the children --- English being their lingua franca --- return from school, hours later, and go out to play in the back yard, with the yellow sun slanting through the pines and over their towering playhouse, you can almost imagine all these people living normally again someday.

According to a \"border security white paper\" produced late last month by aides to Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security, such an agency would be called a federal border administration. It would take control of the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the border enforcement functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Agriculture\\'s agricultural quarantine inspection program.  \"Our borders today are porous and highly vulnerable to penetration by foreign terrorists,\" says the paper proposing the government overhaul. It goes on to note that almost a dozen federal agencies now bear responsibility for controlling the borders.  \"All of these agencies have other missions besides border security, so none has security as its core institutional purpose,\" the paper says, recommending a \"single accountable agency.\"  The proposal has sparked a fierce debate inside the Bush administration and drawn resistance from an array of cabinet agencies, causing Mr. Ridge to back off from an initial effort to get the agency consolidation into the president\\'s new budget, officials said.  Susan Neely, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania, said: \"The governor is on record indicating that where there are more effective and efficient ways to secure our borders, it\\'s something that we would be looking at.

President Bush intends to ask Congress to restore food stamps to legal immigrants who were banned from the program by 1996 welfare restrictions, an administration official said yesterday.  Bush\\'s proposal, which would loosen restrictions that President Bill Clinton signed into law five years ago, is backed by advocates for Hispanic immigrants, a growing bloc of voters whom both Democrats and Republicans want to attract.  The plan, to be presemted next month in Bush\\'s 2003 budget, would make food stamps available to legal immigrants once they have lived in the United States for five years, according to Amy Call, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget. Currently, immigrants cannot receive food stamps unless they have worked in the United States for a decade.  Call said Bush\\'s proposal would place food stamps on par with other welfare programs, including Medicaid and children\\'s health care, that are available to legal immigrants after five years of residency.  \\'Child well-being\\'  \"The President feels that this proposal is important to not only make this consistent with other federal welfare programs, but it will improve child well-being by increasing food-stamp benefits to low-income households, most of which include children,\" Call said.  The income-based program would be phased in over three years, to reach an estimated 363,000 by 2006, she said. It would add $2.1 billion over 10 years to the $17 billion-a-year food-stamp program.

But its appeal has grown for two reasons: Sept. 11, when millions of undocumented immigrants watched their hopes for gaining legal status set back by terrorism, and tougher driving legislation.  Desperate for some kind of official identification or driver\\'s license, many immigrants are naive and desperate enough to pay $100 or more to companies with impressive titles such as the Institute for International Licensing, the International Licensing Bureau and the University Degree Program.  The offers aren\\'t limited to the Internet, said Ramon Moreno, director of protection services at the Mexican Consulate in Atlanta. He\\'s seen businesses on Buford Highway offering \"driver\\'s licenses\" for $100; an ID is $30.  Valid international driver\\'s licenses do exist, but they have to be obtained in your country of origin, and are valid only abroad.

We take issues of employment verification very seriously and have routinely worked with the government to ensure responsible corporate behavior throughout our operations.  Recent articles and editorials following the indictment of Tyson Foods by the U.S. Justice Department, however, have reported at face value the government\\'s allegations that the company \"conspired to smuggle illegal immigrants\" to work in Tyson processing plants. Fairness requires a much closer look at both Tyson\\'s and the DOJ\\'s actions.  First, managers at three (not 15, as has been reported) of our plants apparently did take the bait of a government \"sting\" operation, accepting the offers of undercover federal agents to \"recruit\" and deliver illegally documented workers. This is not, however, proof of a company \"conspiracy\" -- particularly when managers at two other plants refused the same offers made to them and when, at the time, we operated more than 50 plants. Moreover, at the same time one arm of DOJ was investigating Tyson for alleged \"conspiracy\" to smuggle undocumented workers, another arm -- the Division of Civil Rights -- was investigating claims at one of our Missouri plants that we were scrutinizing the documents of Hispanic workers too closely.

The Justice Department has identified about 6,000 young men from the Middle East who have ignored deportation orders, and has decided to make the arrest and removal of them the highest priority among efforts to locate hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals who have defied such rulings, authorities said.  The men hail from nations that U.S. authorities consider havens for members of Osama bin Laden\\'s al Qaeda terrorist network, and some have criminal backgrounds, authorities said. U.S. officials declined to identify the countries of origin or provide other details about the group.  The plan to give priority to a group of Arab and Muslim men over other foreign nationals has raised concerns among some Arab American and immigrant advocate groups that the Bush administration is practicing racial profiling in its war on terrorism. The vast majority of people ignoring deportation orders are Hispanics from Latin America.  Justice officials, including Attorney General John D. Ashcroft, have repeatedly denied that ethnicity plays a role in their anti-terrorism strategies.  The latest effort stems from a broader initiative by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to crack down on \"absconders\" -- the more than 300,000 foreign nationals who have remained in the country illegally after they were ordered deported.

Critics of lax immigration controls rarely home in on a more fitting target: the companies who knowingly hire undocumented workers.  But the case against Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson Foods Inc., one of the world\\'s largest meat processing companies, might provide an occasion to look at the other side of the issue.  In a 36-count indictment, the Justice Department accuses Tyson of \"cultivating a corporate culture in which the hiring of illegal alien workers was condoned in order to meet production goals and cut costs to maximize profits.\"  Immigration officials say Tyson preferred illegal immigrants because they were forced to be more productive and were less likely to complain to management about their working conditions and lack of benefits. And in meat processing, that\\'s reprehensible: It\\'s one of the nation\\'s riskiest industries, with one in four workers injured seriously enough to seek medical attention.  Tyson, two corporate executives (one a human resources manager, the other a division vice president) and four plant managers are accused of conspiring to smuggle illegal immigrants from Mexico to work at 15 Tyson plants in nine states.

Over the last few years, federal officials have accused Tyson of violating labor, environmental and civil rights laws and of making illegal gifts to a cabinet secretary.  Two weeks ago, a federal grand jury indicted Tyson and six employees on charges of conspiring to smuggle illegal immigrants into the United States to work at the company\\'s processing plants.  Tyson insists it has been the target of overzealous investigators and crusading special interest groups. The company largely denies wrongdoing, even in cases it paid to settle years ago.

Everyone in this Ozarks town, where the company is based, knows the Tyson legend, beginning with John Tyson, who founded a poultry empire during the Depression from the back of his truck.

The sweep was conducted at such businesses as McDonald\\'s, TGI Friday\\'s and Sky Chef, a food supplier for airlines. One was employed at a shoeshine shop.  Those detained \"would have access to travelers who have passed through security,\" Heffelfinger said.  The sweep was aimed at businesses and not because of information about any particular person, Heffelfinger said.  \"We didn\\'t know who we would find or which country they had come from,\" he said.  Last month, federal officials said they had arrested or indicted more than 450 workers at 15 airports across the country on such charges as using phony Social Security numbers, lying about past criminal convictions or being in the country illegally.  The arrests have been criticized by some as a long overdue response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and the World Trade towers in New York City.

Take a whiff of Steinway Street in Astoria these days and the scent is unmistakably North African. At night, the air is filled with smoke that smells like candy, escaping through the windows and doors of the growing number of sheesha cafes, where tobacco, dipped in molasses, blended with apple shavings or soaked in rose oil burns in water pipes as tall as the tables.  The tobacco, known as sheesha, is served with fresh juices, strong teas and coffees, rice pudding, ice cream sundaes and waffles. It is carefully tended by waiters who mill about the brightly lit parlors with bits of hot charcoal that, once placed in the pipe, keep the tobacco burning. Alcohol is not served.  The customers, mostly men, order their tobacco by flavor -- regular (molasses), apple (the most popular kind), watermelon, mint, rose, grape, even cappuccino. They usually pay about $4 for a full pipe's worth and a plastic mouthpiece to fit onto the hose of the pipe. And while they smoke, they play dominoes, chess, backgammon or cards, watch Arabic-language television on big screens, talk, debate, rest and think.  The pipe itself has many names -- among them hookah, nargile and hubbly bubbly -- depending on where it is smoked.

The system is scheduled to be operational by July 1.  The system is designed to provide up-to-date computerized information on nonimmigrant foreign students, such as name changes and new dropouts, an official said. Each school will have 24 hours to input changes.  Schools now maintain paper records on foreign students; the records are not kept in a central location and are not provided to the INS unless the agency requests them.  \"It is the single best step the federal government can take to keep closer tabs on international students studying in the United States,\" said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade association that represents 1,800 public and private colleges and universities.  A 1996 immigration-reform law required the INS to upgrade the system by which it keeps track of the foreign students studying in the United States at any time. The system must be in place by January.  Pressure to get the system up and running has increased since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.

The measure sailed through the Missouri House but faces rough seas in the Senate.  The reason the bill is hung up is that the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 had legitimate drivers licenses or other forms of identification that allowed them to move freely before the attack. There's little proof that being denied drivers licenses would have stopped these men. After all, all but three of the 19 had valid visas. But the ease with which the 19 were able to get identification has raised questions about boosting scrutiny and standards for issuing licenses.  House Bill 1811 would ease the rules under which licenses are issued to illegal immigrants. To get a license, an alien would be allowed to supply the state with either a Social Security number or an individual taxpayer identification number from the Internal Revenue Service. Critics argue that those numbers are handed out too freely, and that the relaxed rule would allow the licenses to fall in the hands of terrorists.  In reality, the bill is primarily intended to help illegal Mexican immigrants who come to this country for a better life. When Rep. Henry C. Rizzo, D-Kansas City, introduced HB1811, he saw it partly as a way to help solve the problem of unlicensed immigrants who cause traffic accidents and their lack of insurance or the money to cover the damage to people and property.

The former investment banker, although lacking a background in immigration, planned to use his managerial skills to clear out the agency's storied backlogs and improve its efficiency.  Eight months later, those problems seem almost quaint. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the agency he heads is now seen as a national security problem because of its failure to secure the borders and enforce immigration laws.  Although no one is blaming the new commissioner for long-standing problems, the agency's blunders have kept him in the hot seat.  He was summoned for a grilling by a House subcommittee after the INS mailed student visa certificates for two of the terrorists six months after they died in the Sept. 11 hijacking attacks. He faced more questions when an INS inspector in Norfolk, Va., allowed four Pakistani crewmen to come ashore. All but one have disappeared. He has grown impatient when he is repeatedly asked why his agency can't locate 314,000 aliens who have been ordered deported but have never shown up for removal.

The Senate is expected to deliver the coup de grace soon. Congress has rightly concluded that the immigration agency's storied incompetence can no longer be tolerated at a time of growing concerns about border security and about our open society's ability to keep out terrorists.  There are many reasons to celebrate the demise of the old I.N.S., but building an effective new system will not be easy. The House bill would establish two separate immigration agencies, both still within the Justice Department. One would handle immigration services like citizenship applications; the other would protect the nation's borders and enforce the immigration laws. The two bureaus would report to a new associate attorney general for immigration affairs, but that office would have no direct budgetary or personnel authority over the two agencies.  A preferable Senate alternative proposed by Edward Kennedy and Sam Brownback would also break the I.N.S. into two bureaus, but place them within a new organization similar to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The director, who would report directly to the attorney general, would control the agency's budget and staff.  The White House should work to ensure that the final legislation looks more like the Senate's version, and must determine how best to coordinate the work of the I.N.S. with the patchwork of other federal agencies involved in border security. Absent so far in the debate has been a convincing explanation of why the immigration agency should stay within Justice, where it is a neglected stepchild. Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security, reportedly favored a bolder plan to create a new border security agency that would pull together the I.N.S., the Customs Service and the Coast Guard.  \",\n",

Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who pushed the measure through faster than the White House wanted but eventually got its blessing, called for abolishing an embattled INS he described as an \"undesirable and unwanted stepchild.\"  \"It carries out neither of its crucial missions effectively, enforcing our immigration laws or providing services to immigrants playing by the rules,\" said Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.  The bill passed the GOP-controlled House 405-9. It now goes to the Senate.  The Democratic-led Senate will begin work next week on its own version. INS Commissioner James Ziglar is to appear May 2 before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration.  Both the House bill and a Senate measure sponsored by the subcommittee chairman, Sen.

Under Sensenbrenner\\'s plan, the Justice Department would create a single agency to enforce laws and keep unqualified people from entering the United States. A second agency would smooth the way to possible citizenship for legal immigrants.  Many in Congress believe abolishing the INS is necessary because of a series of foul-ups.

For the first time since 1924, there will be a reduction in the number of foreign-born people who are legally permitted to come to the United States.  The proposals have been criticized by an unusual array of interests, from traditional supporters of immigration to American industries, particularly high-tech companies, that need more professionals than the United States produces.  These are among the provisions in one or the other of the bills:  *Slash the number of people allowed to immigrate legally to a maximum of 535,000 a year, down from the present average of about 800,000.  *Make it more difficult for foreigners to gain political asylum and place a ceiling of 50,000 on the number of refugees admitted each year -- about half the number accepted annually in the last five years.  *Sharply increase the financial requirements for an American citizen to sponsor an immigrant.  *Establish a national registry of Social Security numbers and alien registration numbers, and require companies to use it to verify the legal status of job applicants.  \",\n",

Too many of us see any move to limit immigration as nothing other than totalitarianism, profiling, racism, hysteria and a denial of our identity as a nation of immigrants.  What hogwash. Sept. 11 put us in the middle of something that has no precedent on this scale in this country.  For one, Zacarias Moussaoui, known as 9/11\\'s 20th hijacker, stood up in his federal court proceeding and called for the destruction of the United States and the Jewish people.  He fired his lawyers, announced that there would be more bombings by terrorists and referred to \"the shoe bomber\" as \"a brother.\"  As you may recall, Moussaoui was arrested last year when he attempted to learn how to take off and fly large planes but had no interest in finding out how to land them. Had he not been in custody, it is now assumed that he would have been on the most sensational murder raid since the Black September killing of the Israeli Olympic team in 1972.  The other eye-opener comes with the arrest of Ahmed Sattar, the Staten Island mailman who was the spokesman for blind cleric Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and is being charged with providing support to a terror group.

The contract, signed March 6, is with Jeffrey L. Jones, owner of Lawn Restoration Service Inc., for maintenance of District parks and recreation centers from April to Sept. 30.

If they couldn\\'t obtain employment so easily, many wouldn\\'t come.  Last week, the House Judiciary Committee took the first step toward ending the \"jobs magnet\" by narrowly approving a national registry. Unfortunately, the measure faces an uphill battle on the House floor.  It shouldn\\'t. The registry offers a way for employers to verify the legal status of all job applicants, and would leave them with no excuse for having hired illegal labor.  Since 1986, it has been against the law for employers to hire illegal immigrants, but that law has lacked teeth. While employers must check every immigrant\\'s legal status, applicants can use any of 29 documents as proof, and many are easily forged.  The national registry would combine data from the Social Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. All job applicants, including U.S. citizens, would be required to show their Social Security card or green card. A phone call to a toll-free number would verify that the person was legally eligible for employment.  Unfortunately, some Republicans have branded it the \"1-800-BIG- BROTHER\" line. They argue that the registry would invade privacy and involve the government in every hiring decision.  That\\'s ridiculous. Most citizens already must present their Social Security number to get a job.

While she was waiting, a second sister, who sold exotic seashells for a living, visited the United States as a tourist, liked the place and decided to stay on illegally with her three children.  To this sister\\'s surprise and good fortune, in 1986 Congress offered amnesty to illegal immigrants, and she and her children became legal residents, eligible for citizenship. Today she works as a saleswoman in a department store, and her children have all graduated from high school with honors.  Meanwhile, as the banker sister continues to wait, the mood of the country, and of Congress, has changed. Struggling to stem a flood of legal and illegal immigrants, Congress is preparing to cut deeply into family-reunification quotas this fall and drop people like her from eligibility.  If the changes are enacted, the United States would shut the door on about 2.4 million people -- the brothers, sisters and adult children of citizens and legal residents -- who have waited for years or decades to enter the country as legal immigrants. That number nearly matches the three million illegal immigrants granted amnesty in 1986.  \"It is some kind of injustice when those who played by the rules can\\'t get in, but those who broke the rules are now going to become citizens,\" said Ms. Canton, an import specialist for the United States Customs Service.

'In light of 9/11, we need to do our part to help regulate the  illegal immigrants in this country,' said the bill's sponsor, Rep.  Don Lee, R-Littleton.  Critics of his proposal are gearing up for a fight. They say  Lee's House Bill 1448 gives police too much power and would allow  officers to lock up immigrants for nothing more than simply  forgetting to keep their paperwork with them.  'That could be the sole reason for detaining an individual,'  said Senate President Stan Matsunaka, D-Loveland. 'That's pretty  far-reaching.'  As the law stands, officers may detain immigrants if they  discover a warrant for the immigrant's arrest, or if the  Immigration and Naturalization Service says that person is here  illegally.  'As a state, we've got to do everything we can to help the  INS,' Lee said.  Under Lee's plan, if police discover on their own that a  foreigner is here illegally, that's enough for an officer to take  that person to jail until the INS can take possession of him or  her.  But 'that could be who knows how long,' Matsunaka said.  Lee dismissed concerns over abuses of police power, since he  said police officers normally use discretion in stopping suspects.

From before the American Revolution until today, Americans have periodically worried that immigrants would maintain their own languages and split the United States into a Babel-like collection of tribes.  That fear has manifested itself in periodic backlashes, from Benjamin Franklin's warning that immigrants would never learn English, to World War I-era attempts to ban the teaching of German.  Now comes the latest move, to make English the country's official language, to require the government to print most of its documents in English and, in the language war's biggest battleground, to ban bilingual education.  Though popular - three out of five Americans support the official-language idea - the movement so far appears largely symbolic, a political salve.  Consider:  * Federal measures pending in Congress would prohibit foreign languages in government documents but would not prohibit multilingual education.  * Many of the state laws or constitutional amendments are toothless. Florida, for instance, amended its constitution in 1988 to make English the official state language, but its Legislature has never followed up with the laws needed to enforce it.  * Dole himself sends mixed signals, saying he wants to end multilingual education, while also saying schools should continue programs to help immigrants learn English.

The House Judiciary Committee is prepared to approve an unusual bipartisan bill on Wednesday that would abolish the immigration service and split its functions into two separate bureaus, one for enforcement and one for services. The bureaus would be overseen by a new associate attorney general, who would be the third-ranking official in the Justice Department, the immigration service's parent agency.  The full House could vote by the end of the month on the legislation, which has the support of both Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, and Representative Richard A.

Proponents argue that the bill would elevate the priority of immigration issues in the government, and separate the agency's often conflicting responsibilities.  Similar legislation in the Senate sponsored by Senators Edward M.

Reorganizing the immigration service, one of the government's fastest-growing agencies, with 37,000 employees and a $6.2 billion budget, has been a legislative perennial since the late 1970's. But past efforts to restructure the agency have always failed.  This year, however, what remaining defenders the agency had on Capitol Hill jumped ship after a series of mishaps.

The INS is a dysfunctional agency and has been for as long as I can remember.  Its immigration service operation is almost unworkable, and the increase in immigration only makes matters worse.  Its enforcement operation is reasonably effective, given the magnitude of the task and the lack of resources.  In 1973 President Richard Nixon submitted a reorganization plan to Congress. It created the Drug Enforcement Administration. It also created a single border-control agency by removing the Border Patrol from the INS. Because of INS union opposition, the Border Patrol plan was dropped because at that time drug enforcement was a priority.  Now dramatic restructuring of our border security operation is a must. If the president and Congress bestow Cabinet rank and departmental status on the Homeland Security Office, that might simplify restructuring, although the bureaucratic screams will be deafening. The least that should be done would be to consolidate border inspection and enforcement services into one agency.

The high court ruled 5-4 that Jose Castro, an undocumented Mexican who had used a friend\\'s ID to get his job, was not entitled to the back pay awarded to three other laid-off workers because Castro had violated the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 by using fraudulent documents to get a job.  In other words, since Castro was working here without legal authorization, he was not entitled to the legal protections that are the right of American workers.  Writing for the majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist remarked: \"Indeed, awarding back pay in a case like this not only trivializes the immigration laws, it also condones and encourages future violations.\"  Hardly.  Desperate undocumented workers will continue to seek employment here, and there will always be someone willing to look the other way when work authorization documents are produced. Companies now have an additional incentive to hire undocumented workers, given that the ruling is tantamount to immunity from universal fair labor practices.

This news has led to calls to close America's borders and track down all illegal aliens.  Nonsense, say I. What we clearly need is a new visa category specifically for hijackers.  Experience has proven that the best way to keep people out of this country is by having a visa category that fits them and their purpose, subjecting them to all the rudeness, inefficiency, and ineptitude for which the INS is famous.  The death penalty for hijacking is no deterrent. Trying to live with the INS, however, may daunt even the most dedicated suicide bomber.  Here are the steps in my new Hijackers Immigration Reform Act:  First, Congress will pass a vague and complicated Act that admits foreign visitors to the United States for the limited purpose of committing terrorist hijackings. The visitors must prove that they have at least two years' experience as professional hijackers during the years immediately preceding the application. This would have to be paid hijacking work, not volunteer stuff. They would have to show that they have adequate financial support from a recognized terrorist organization.  The intending visitors must also show that in the relevant market, there is an actual shortage of qualified, willing American hijackers, so that their admission under a hijacker visa would not take the job of an honest, hardworking American hijacker.  \",\n",

But can this nation achieve this goal if we maintain current levels of immigration?  Trying to prevent future terrorists from entering the United States and tracking down and deporting criminal immigrants are very costly measures. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is already overwhelmed. How can the understaffed INS be effective in eradicating terrorism at home if it is burdened with more than 800,000 applications for permanent residency annually, in addition to hundreds of thousands of applications for \"temporary\" worker and student visas and millions of tourist visas?  Since Sept. 11, the United States has spent well over $60 billion to combat terrorism and to rebuild from the attacks. It would be fiscally wise and responsible to adopt a three-year moratorium on most categories of visas from all countries. That would free INS resources for the fight against illegal immigration.  This step is particularly necessary because of the following disturbing developments:  Prize-winning Mexican novelist Elena Poniatowska, who has taught at Ivy League universities, said: \"Mexico is recovering the territories yielded to the United States by means of migratory tactics.\" She also said Hispanics are \"imposing their culture\" on the United States.  Furthermore, the well-respected French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur carried a news article last August titled: \"Californie: La reconquista des Latinos,\" which means \"Reconquering of California by Latinos.\" In December, The Associated Press reported that up to 500,000 Mexicans are expected to migrate to the United States each year over the next 30 years. The potential impact is clear, because seven states in this country have populations of fewer than one million.  ',\n",

But because he tried to enter the country using a false passport, Mr. Jarno was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and has bounced from one adult jail to another. He spent nine months in jail before receiving a hearing, at which the immigration agency challenged his claims about his age and mental capacity and declared that he should be deported.  \"I thought I could have a new life here,\" Mr. Jarno said in an interview, which was translated by one of his lawyers, Benoit Jacqmotte. \"I also thought this was a country that respected human rights. But I am not sure anymore.\"  Malik Jarno has emerged as a symbol of the plight of the nearly 5,000 unaccompanied children who are detained by the immigration agency each year.  While the agency says it works with nonprofit organizations and public agencies to place children in the least restrictive setting possible, many are sent to jails for months at a time without access to critical services.  In addition, up to 80 percent of unaccompanied juveniles appear in court without a lawyer or guardian, legal advocates say. That often means added time in detention, because immigration judges are reluctant to issue final orders of removal against children without counsel.  ',\n",

Three major banks - Wells Fargo, Bank One and U.S. Bank - are  agreeing to take the ID as proof of identification, thus allowing  Mexican immigrants to open accounts, use bank facilities and  products and eventually qualify for loans that can lead to homes  or businesses.  Mexican President Vicente Fox has essentially put his word  behind the IDs as being valid. They have been accepted in Texas  and California since last year. We look forward to other  businesses and agencies also accepting them as legitimate  identification.  Not only does this practice help many immigrants operate  within the mainstream, it also helps protect their money and lower  the risk of crime.  Because of a lack of identification, many Mexican nationals  carry a lot of cash with them, or keep large amounts in their  homes. This behavior, which is widely known, puts them at risk for  robbery. By opening accounts, they can keep their money safe and  still have access to it at just about any time from just about anywhere in the world.  Those opposed to the acceptance of the ID say legal residents  don't need this form of identification. In order to open an  account, an immigrant must also have a Social Security number,  which is impossible for undocumented immigrants to obtain, or a  U.S. tax identification number, which is equally difficult to get.

Some are mixed in with violent juvenile delinquents, and a few have been held in jail for weeks after being granted asylum. When taken from jail to court hearings, they are shackled and handcuffed, and no arriving minor is entitled to free legal representation.

The report, produced for the privately financed Pew Hispanic Center, was timed for release as President Bush meets today with Mexican President Vicente Fox to discuss border and migration issues.  Although a major amnesty plan is not on the agenda, officials continue to discuss a possible increase in permits to allow more temporary workers from Mexico.  The Pew research indicates that the majority of the 7.8 million illegal residents in the United States come from Mexico. It also found that close to 4 percent of the urban workforce is illegal.  These undocumented workers tend to be clustered in low-wage service and labor jobs, including garment-making, meatpacking and agricultural work, the study found. They also make up 6 percent of construction laborers and almost 5 percent of all manufacturing workers.  Philip Martin, one of the researchers and an economist at the University of California, Davis, estimated that 47 percent of the 2.5 million farm workers are in the United States illegally. Large farms that employ contract labor tend to have more illegals than smaller farms. Fruit and vegetable growers tend to hire illegal help more often than livestock farmers do, he said.  Martin said the supply of cheap, illegal labor has been plentiful during the past 20 years.

James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (Mich.), the committee\\'s ranking Democrat, would create a clearer split between the INS\\'s enforcement and administrative functions by giving the two separate budgets.  The House negotiators reached the compromise after the embarrassing disclosure last week that the INS had approved visas for two of the Sept. 11 hijackers six months after the terrorist attacks.  The agreement would keep the two INS divisions within the Justice Department and create the position of associate attorney general for immigration affairs, who would be the department\\'s third-ranking official. The proposal also calls for the creation of a \"children\\'s office\" to deal with immigration problems involving minors.  The proposal, because it is a bipartisan compromise, has a strong chance of passing in the House, congressional aides said. But it will have to vie with an alternative that will be introduced in the Senate by Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who is looking for GOP sponsors.

They are eminently employable, will be no drain on the welfare system and will make a real contribution to the country. All of this is true. Others reply that there are plenty of highly trained Americans -- many of them college graduates -- who could and should be filling those job slots. They point out that without foreign competition, Americans would compete for and perform well in these jobs. This is also true. In the coming months, Congress will try to find some middle ground.  The total number of immigrants and refugees admitted into this country (now 800,000 a year) will almost certainly be reduced by Congress. The final figure will be somewhere between 400,000 and 550,000 a year. The mix will also shift, with peripheral relatives such as married siblings excluded and the percentage of available places allotted to skilled workers rising. But because the total will be smaller, the actual number of spots for skilled workers will go down from the present 140,000 a year to something in the 75,000 to 100,000 range.  ',\n",

The merger of the three agencies, each responsible for part of the nation's border security, would be an effort to streamline government functions and shore up the nation's porous border defenses as a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The restructuring, which would require congressional approval, is intended to improve coordination among the thousands of federal workers who protect U.S. borders but work for different organizations.  Similar proposals have been rejected since the Nixon administration, but the imminent agreement reflects the government's new sense of urgency in overcoming bureaucratic hurdles.  Senior administration officials will meet today to finalize the merger proposal and draft recommendations for President Bush, officials said. The consolidation has been a priority for Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, who has been forced to negotiate bureaucratic turf battles within the administration.  Although top Bush advisers have agreed to combine the INS and Border Patrol, which are part of the Justice Department, with Customs, which is part of the Treasury Department, they have yet to decide whether the new agency will be part of Justice or a stand-alone organization, possibly under Ridge.

Last week the furor over the Immigration and Naturalization Service's visa approvals for two terrorist hijackers underscored how much work needs to be done in the domestic security area. Congress has many of the same questions the rest of the nation has about how that could happen and what can be done to keep it from happening again.  The administration asserts that any questions by Congress should properly be answered by the various agencies involved, like the I.N.S. That is no doubt true. But the $38 billion the administration proposes to spend next year on such security would be spread across more than 80 departments and agencies, according to the Senate appropriations staff. Mr. Ridge is the one who decided how much should go to immigration services, as opposed to border patrols or anti-bioterrorism efforts. Only he can explain the rationale behind those priorities.  \",\n",
       " 'IMM-11965  PRIMARY  INS managers bounced; Visas for hijackers get bureaucrats reassigned  Washington --- The Immigration and Naturalization Service reassigned four managers Friday amid embarrassment over student visas issued to two of the Sept. 11 hijackers six months after their suicide attacks.  INS Commissioner James Ziglar blamed the blunder on \"a breakdown in communica- tion\" that he said \"is unacceptable and will not be allowed.\"  Also Friday, Attorney General John Ashcroft sent a letter to Congress asking for authority to fire INS employees who violate government policies.  \"Today more than ever, we need to ensure that America\\'s borders are secure and that proper enforcement actions are being taken against those unlawfully present in the United States,\" Ashcroft wrote.  The highest-ranking official removed Friday was Michael Pearson, who held the No. 3 position at the agency. Pearson headed all field operations, and thus supervised those who mailed visas to the hijackers.  The agency\\'s director of international affairs, Jeffrey Weiss, will be replaced. He was in charge of refugee and asylum programs and overseas offices.  The other two managers also headed INS operations that have come under recent criticism: daily operations throughout the agency, and INS inspection teams at ports of entry.  A Justice Department spokesman said the four career managers were being transferred, not fired. He said their replacements had been chosen earlier but that the job changes were speeded up due to this week\\'s visa \"debacle.\"  Student visas for hijackers Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi arrived Monday at Huffman Aviation, a Venice, Fla., flight school. Atta and Al-Shehhi, who had taken lessons at the school, flew on separate flights that crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.  ',\n",

Michael Pearson, the head of all field operations and widely recognized as the agency\\'s third-ranking official, was relieved of his job and will be reassigned, a Justice Department official said. The agency\\'s director of international affairs, Jeffrey L. Weiss, will also be reassigned.  In all, four senior officials responsible for immigration services, policies and enforcement were replaced, officials said.  \"The breakdown in communication, highlighted by this week\\'s events, at the I.N.S. is unacceptable and will not be allowed,\" James W. Ziglar, the commissioner of immigration and naturalization, said in a statement. \"These changes begin the process of accountability as we move forward with restructuring the I.N.S.\"  The agency\\'s notice approving the student visas for Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, received this week by a Florida flight school six months after the attacks, ignited an uproar from the White House to Capitol Hill and renewed calls to overhaul the agency or abolish it.  Justice Department officials said that the personnel changes made today were part of Mr. Ziglar\\'s larger plan to separate the agency\\'s service and enforcement functions, which often conflict with each other.  \"These changes were part of a broader restructuring plan that were in the works,\" a Justice Department official said. \"This week\\'s debacle was the impetus to move up our timetable to remedy the immediate needs.\" The service is an agency of the Justice Department.

The study, a joint project by the Pew Hispanic Center and the Brookings Institution Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, confirms growth patterns defined in initial 2000 census data and elaborates on patterns of dispersion.  The findings indicate that while metropolitan areas like New York, Los Angeles and Miami still accounted for the largest increases in the number of Latinos from 1980 to 2000, smaller metropolitan areas charted a faster rate of growth.  More than half of Latinos now live in the suburbs, and many migrants in new destinations are skipping city centers and heading straight to jobs and housing in outlying areas.  In addition, the study indicates that the expansive growth over the past two decades will probably continue because the vast majority of migrants are men who will bring women and children to the population base in the coming years.  \"This confirms that what we\\'re seeing is not one trend replacing another, not urban being replaced with rural or suburban,\" said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center and co-author of the study. \"What we\\'re seeing is several trends expanding at once and that each of them have potential staying power.\"  ',\n",

Mr. Bergeron was paraphrased as saying that judgments in such a civil case would have no immediate bearing on the generals\\' immigration status.  Immigration law excludes persons who have been or are engaged in \"genocide, or otherwise ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in the killing of any person because of race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion.\"  Having knowledge of the verdict, the INS must act either to rescind the legal permanent residency of the generals, or, if they already are United States citizens, the INS must move to denaturalize and deport them based on fraud.

Kooritzky, 63, was arrested at his Capital Law Centers office on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington last week after a Labor Department probe found that he had filed about 2,700 requests for labor certification on behalf of immigrants since last year. Kooritzky\\'s applications claimed that individual restaurants could not find American workers and needed the immigrants, but the Labor Department said the restaurants did not even know of the applications.  Yesterday\\'s hearing was for Ronald W. Bogardus, 65, a contract engineer for the State Department who is accused of being Kooritzky\\'s accomplice. During a search of Bogardus\\'s Arlington apartment, agents found a suitcase stuffed with what they believed was $ 500,000.  But Labor Department Special Agent Andrew H.

More than 40 immigrants are believed to have been riding in the truck Saturday but only 27 have been accounted for, said Lynn Ligon, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Fourteen passengers remained hospitalized Sunday, and three were jailed for entering the country illegally. Three women and five children were released to Dallas-area family members, Ligon said. They will be given the choice of voluntary return to Mexico or appearing at an immigration hearing.  After a 12-hour journey, the immigrants poured out of the 53-foot trailer exhausted and dehydrated at a truck stop.  The truck left the scene before authorities arrived. It was later discovered about 40 miles north of Dallas in Anna, where two bodies were found in the parked rig. Another man who stumbled from the back of the truck was hospitalized in serious condition.  The temperature hit 96 degrees in Dallas on Saturday and one of the victims said they had futilely torn a small hole in the truck's roof for air.

At least 91 people have died since October in the U.S. Border Patrol\\'s Tucson sector, covering most of southern Arizona. More than half of those deaths have been heat-related.  \"It has been a real challenge to figure out how to be most effective in the desert,\" said Kittie Ufford-Chase, a volunteer with the Samaritan Patrol. \"This has been a needle-in-a-haystack proposition. It\\'s huge out there.\"  Fewer than a dozen migrants were found in the first three weeks of the patrols.  The patrol\\'s organizers include several holdovers from the sanctuary movement, a faith-based effort to help Central Americans fleeing political persecution in the 1980s. Eight sanctuary members were convicted of conspiracy or other charges involving illegal entry of aliens.  But Samaritan Patrol organizers say that their operations are strictly humanitarian and within the law and that their goals are much different.  \"It evolved because there were people who were appalled by the almost daily deaths of migrants trying to find their way into this country,\" said Rabbi Joseph Weisenbaum, a sanctuary veteran who helped organize the Samaritan Patrol. \"It began and continues to function as a humanitarian gesture.\"  Its 120 to 150 volunteers patrol areas where an allied group, Humane Borders, does not have permanent water stations for immigrants crossing thedesert.

Claudio Carpinteri stepped off his plane from Rome early this week - on his first trip to the United States - and found himself in an hourlong line at the immigration clearing area at Philadelphia International Airport.  \"It was quite hot, and, after a journey of nine hours, it was not very pleasing to find such a long queue,\" he said afterward.  Carpinteri\\'s experience - and even longer delays for other overseas visitors - have airport and local tourism officials worried. They say a shortage of federal Immigration and Naturalization Service agents has caused waits for arriving passengers of up to two hours that, if not addressed, could stain Philadelphia\\'s reputation among international leisure and business travelers.  The agency is 12 inspectors short of its budgeted target in Philadelphia. As a result, even during peak arrival periods, there are sometimes just seven to 10 INS inspectors on duty, so some of the agency\\'s 14 booths are not staffed, US Airways\\' station manager, Rick Pelc, said in a March memo on the problem.  US Airways, Philadelphia\\'s dominant carrier, is particularly concerned because it is preparing to open a $442 million international terminal here next winter.

It wasn't hard for the two Mexicans to find work in Virginia's construction industry. But one thing has become harder for illegal immigrants since Sept. 11: getting an ID.  That's why the two friends joined scores of other immigrants last weekend at a fluorescent-lighted church hall in Charlottesville. There, Mexican diplomats were issuing a new, high-tech ID for Mexicans living in the United States -- a card that has quietly emerged as a key U.S. document for a huge group of illegal immigrants.  So far this year, the Mexican government has distributed about a half-million of the cards, known as matriculas consulares. In recent months, the cards have been recognized as official identification by nearly 200 U.S. police departments in such cities as Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston, according to the Mexican Embassy. Dozens of banks and city governments accept them. Now the cards are starting to appear in the Washington area.  Supporters say the cards help hardworking immigrants who must present an official photo ID for basic necessities, from cashing a check to registering a child for school. Obtaining such an ID has become much more difficult since Virginia and other states, reacting to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, stiffened requirements for issuing driver's licenses and other identification.  Critics, however, say the Mexican government is trying to issue credentials for its citizens here, undermining the U.S. identification system and aiding lawbreakers.  \",\n",

Tell the INS     Aliens must report within 10 days - or else  Attorney General John Ashcroft warned noncitizens in the U.S. yesterday that they will have to inform the government promptly of any change of address or face fines or even deportation.  The Justice Department said the rule, which requires them to notify the Immigration and Naturalization Service within 10 days of a move, has been on the books for 50 years but rarely enforced.  \"Since 9/11, we have been doing a top-to-bottom review of INS regulations,\" said department spokesman Mark Corallo. \"This is another measure that will help us better secure our borders by allowing us to better track the whereabouts of visitors to this country.\"  He said the new plan is aimed at closing loopholes in the immigration tracking system that \"allowed some of the terrorists to go unnoticed.\"  It\\'s not clear how many could be involved in the program.  Bigger backlog  \"We\\'re going to wait and see how many people actually do change their address and whether we have the resources to cope with that [or] if we\\'re going to need to hire people just to input this,\" said INS spokeswoman Danielle Sheahan.

But the government is taking longer to approve applicants, as it seeks to weed out potential terrorists.  Numbers released Tuesday by the Immigration and Naturalization Service reflect an America changed by the events of Sept. 11.  Immigration officials reported 519,523 applications for citizenship in the eight-month period that ended May 31 - a jump of 65 percent over the same period a year before.  Even so, the number of people who got citizenship in the eight months - 337, 590 - dropped by 10 percent from the same period a year earlier.  In the days after the attacks, the government slowed the screening process because of fears of further terrorism, officials said.  At the same time, larger numbers of immigrants sought citizenship - partly to show patriotism and partly to avoid a federal dragnet that has detained thousands of immigrants on technicalities since Sept. 11.  The reasoning was spelled out by Ismat Bayumi, 37, of Dallas, who works with people seeking citizenship through the Catholic Charities. He said, \"People are eager to apply for naturalization because of the problems they run into, or they have a friend who had a problem with INS.\"  Bayumi arrived in the United States in 1996, seeking asylum from Sudan, and became a citizen May 23. He had applied for citizenship in November, as soon as he had lived legally inside the United States for five years, as required.  ',\n",

Pakistanis say they are just eking out a living like thousands of other immigrants in the city - documented and not - often sharing small apartments with vague acquaintances and saving money to send back home.

The man, Nabil al-Marabh, 35, was found hiding in a tractor-trailer at the Niagara Falls border crossing, and he was carrying a false Canadian passport, the authorities said. Although United States intelligence officials had suspicions about Mr. Marabh\\'s links to Mr. bin Laden, United States immigration officials turned Mr. Marabh over to the Canadian authorities, who released him on bail after his lawyer promised that an uncle would keep him out of trouble.  It was not until after the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, when Mr. Marabh was placed on a list of possible Al Qaeda operatives, that he was hunted down and arrested. The authorities said that they suspected him of providing documents to the hijackers of the planes that struck the twin towers.  As part of a plea agreement, Mr. Marabh pleaded guilty on Monday in Federal District Court in Buffalo. While the maximum penalty is five years in prison, officials expect Mr. Marabh to receive a term of two to eight months. However, he is likely to serve no additional time because he has been in prison since his arrest in September. \"As it stands, after serving his sentence the immigration service has ordered him deported to Syria,\" said Marc Gromis, the assistant United States attorney handling the case.

Some 1,200 South Asian and Arab men were arrested in sweeps after the terrorist attacks, and 750 of them were ultimately detained on immigration violations, the Justice Department said. As of four weeks ago, when the latest head count was released, all but 74 had been expelled to their home countries or, in a handful of cases, released to resume their lives in the United States.  The government, citing national security concerns, has refused to disclose the names of those foreigners it held in detention, including the vast majority who were never charged with anything other than overstaying a visa. It has also banned the public from the deportation hearings of \"special interest detainees\" once it has finished investigating them.  The secret detentions and secret hearings have been attacked in federal lawsuits filed by civil liberties groups in Washington, D.C., New Jersey and Michigan, and those cases continue to wend their way through the judicial system.  \"The fact that many of the so-called 9/11 detainees have been deported in no way diminishes the significance of the current legal challenges,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, adding that some detainees are still affected by the government\\'s secrecy policies.

Travel agents, airline officials, tour operators and others worry that a weak international visitors market will grow more feeble if the administration further limits who stays, and for how long, in the United States.  Atlanta, while better insulated than tourism-dependent cities, already feels the pinch and could lose millions of dollars and thousands of jobs if foreigners stay away.  All foreign visitors will face more exact questioning and longer lines as border control agents try to ensure that terror like that of Sept. 11 is never revisited.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service went to court in Atlanta on Tuesday in an attempt to ship out Thar Abdeljaber, a 30-year-old Palestinian father of five.  The INS says he broke a law requiring the 17.8 million noncitizens in the United States to report address changes within 10 days of moving.  It\\'s a law that even the INS admits it rarely enforces, a sentiment echoed by immigration lawyers.  \"The reality is that nobody is deported on the basis of that simple a violation,\" said Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"It\\'s ridiculous.\"  In fact, the INS\\' own guidelines say failure to report an address change \"shall not normally serve as the sole basis for . . . deportation.\"  So how did Abdeljaber end up in an orange jail jumpsuit, hands cuffed to his waist?

Dozens of executives from leading high-tech firms yesterday descended on Capitol Hill to argue for separating the issues of legal and illegal immigration in proposed legislation that is moving through the House and taking shape in the Senate.  The lobbying effort reflects concerns among U.S. companies that their ability to hire highly skilled foreign talent as legal immigrants will become ensnared in a political backlash against illegal immigration.  \"Legal immigration strengthens and energizes America,\" the National Association of Manufacturers, which counts 13,500 corporate members nationwide, said in a statement. \"America\\'s high-tech employees and international personnel should not be considered in the same bill as undocumented entrants and criminal law violators.\"  The main target of the lobbying effort is a House bill sponsored by Rep.

It would cut legal immigration by 30 percent, reduce refugee admissions by more than 50 percent and crack down on illegal immigrants through a variety of means including border fences and more Border Patrol agents.

The United Nations estimates that at least 185 million people -- up from 70 million three decades ago -- are now living in countries other than where they were born.  But demographers say that attempts to analyze these population movements are often frustrated by government officials who try to inflate or to obscure them.  Now, in the midst of an intensifying debate about immigration in Europe and the United States, in part fueled by fears of terrorists crossing borders, the United Nations population division will meet on Thursday and Friday in New York to begin exploring global cooperation on the issue. The meeting is expected to be the largest of its kind, attracting the participation of governments, refugee organizations, volunteer agencies and policy analysts.  \"This time, people are serious,\" said Demetrios Papademetriou, a former public policy analyst in the United States Labor Department who is now the co-director of the Migration Policy Institute, a research organization in Washington created by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace two years ago. \"There is a different air to this meeting. A lot of people are now making serious investments.\"  Beyond what are perceived as problems of immigration in richer countries, there is mounting evidence of threats to peace and life from migrations, often forced, in poor nations.

Everyone will have to show another government-issued document, such as a passport or a birth certificate, and prove that they are allowed to be in the United States.  \"What we need to see is at least two forms of identification,\" said Brian Lamb, director of the vehicle services division of the Public Safety Department. Minnesota drivers renewing their licenses won\\'t be affected.  For temporary immigrants, clerks at driver\\'s license counters will use the documentation to create special licenses that bear the date by which the immigrant is supposed to leave the country, and the words \"status check\" will appear on the front and back of the license.

       " \"IMM-12107  PRIMARY  LA GUNMAN WAS NEARLY DEPORTED IN '96; BUT YEAR LATER HE GAINED RESIDENCY THROUGH WIFE  The government had started deportation proceedings in 1996 against the Egyptian immigrant who gunned down two people at Los Angeles International Airport. But the following year, the man gained U.S. residency because his wife received a valid visa, officials said Saturday.  It was unclear what caused the Immigration and Naturalization Service to reject Hesham Mohamed Hadayet's first petition for residency and begin the deportation process, said INS spokesman Francisco Arcaute.  A year later, in 1997, Hadayet was granted permanent resident status because his wife, Hala, had become a permanent resident, Arcaute said. The INS allows foreign nationals to work and live in the United States if they have a relative who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.  Hadayet's uncle, Hassan Mostaffa Mahfouz, said in an interview in Egypt that Hadayet was happy in the United States and had about a year remaining before he qualified for U.S. citizenship.  Hadayet was the fourth person in line Thursday at the ticket counter for El Al, Israel's national airline, when he began firing, killing two people and wounding three others, authorities said. He fired off 10 or 11 bullets before he was shot dead by an El Al security guard.  In response to the shooting, the new U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced Saturday that it would station armed law enforcement officers at airport ticket counters and other public areas of airports.  \",\n",

Airport Shooting Was Planned, Investigators Say; Officials Believe Egyptian Immigrant Acted Alone  FBI investigators said Friday that the gunman who went on a rampage inside Los Angeles International Airport on July 4 was an Egyptian immigrant living in Southern California who had no criminal history or known ties to terrorist groups but apparently planned the attack in advance.  The FBI identified the gunman as Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, 41, who ran a limousine service from his home in the middle-class suburb of Irvine, Calif. Hadayet fatally shot two people near a ticket counter for El Al Israel Airlines and wounded three others before he was shot dead by a security guard for the airline. The exchange of gunfire sent scores of travelers ducking for cover and forced thousands more to evacuate.  Israeli officials are calling Hadayet\\'s attack an act of terrorism, but the FBI again refused to do so Friday -- even though bureau investigators said they have not ruled out that possibility.  Richard Garcia, the FBI official leading the investigation, said details of Hadayet\\'s life and his motive for the attack are still sketchy but investigators believe he acted alone, shot his victims randomly and came to the airport \"with the intention of killing people.\" Investigators said Hadayet carried no identification and was armed with two handguns and a six-inch hunting knife.  Hadayet\\'s name has not been on any law enforcement \"watch lists\" for terrorist activity in the United States or abroad, and investigators have found no evidence to suggest he was part of an organized conspiracy, Garcia said.

But human rights say the number of crossings might have declined in recent months because of heightened security following the attacks of Sept. 11 and the U.S. economic downturn.  The foreign department said in a news release Thursday that 167 migrants of all nationalities died trying to cross the U.S. border in the first half of the year, and 117 were Mexicans.  It said 210 Mexicans died during the same period in 2001 and 283 during the first half months of 2000. It did not give figures for other nationalities.  The number represents deaths on both sides of the border.  Arrests by the U.S. Border Patrol this year have dropped to their lowest level in nearly a decade, another indication that there may be fewer deaths because fewer people are crossing.  \"Because a lot more INS agents are out there, they could be rescuing more people,\" suggested Steven Camarota, Center for Immigration Studies in Washington.  Previously death tolls had been increasing, largely because a growing number of people were trying to avoid detection by taking a more chall enging route through remote deserts and mountains.  The greatest death toll so far this year has been in the Arizona desert region of the Tohono O\\'odham Indian Reservation, where 55 people had died from dehydration, the foreign department said.

After all, I\\'m told, illegal immigration is against the law. Period.  Well, I will certainly be the first to admit my personal bias toward finding ways to help Latino immigrants grow roots in North Carolina. My bias grows out of the belief that immigrants can contribute to economic development and diversity in the Old North State. There\\'s no neutrality claim coming from this corner.  But before those who believe current American immigration law was sent down the sacred mountain with Moses get too comfortable, they should take a closer look at their own biases. For one thing, it is important to understand that for just about every undocumented Latino worker hired in North Carolina, there is an employer who is also breaking the law.  Most of these employers probably think of themselves as decent, law-abiding citizens who just happen to be caught in a legal trap that forces them to play the role of government agents. Nevertheless, these employers are breaking the law, too. There is too much information available about Latinos\\' use of fake Social Security numbers for these employers to pretend they do not know that they\\'re hiring illegal immigrants. More importantly, I think the debate about the immigration issue would improve if all of us took a closer look at the role that law plays in American society. It\\'s a role that is actually quite different from the one it plays in Latin America.  ',\n",

Mohammed Nour al-Din Saffi, a citizen of New Zealand who has worked in commercial aviation, planned to attend classes at Aeroservice Aviation Center, said James Goldman, an assistant director for investigations at the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela said one of the Sept. 11 hijackers trained at the same flight school. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel identified the hijacker as Ziad Jarrah, who is believed to have commandeered the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania.  According to the INS, the Iraqi leader's stepson was traveling as a tourist and had not applied for a student visa that would have allowed him to take courses.  There was no evidence that Saffi was connected to any terrorist group.  Goldman said Saffi was seeking recertification training at the flight school. The FBI said he is employed by an airline in New Zealand.  Saffi, 36, failed to tell customs agents of his intent to take courses when he arrived Tuesday in Los Angeles on a flight from New Zealand, Goldman said.  Orihuela, the FBI spokeswoman, said Saffi was tracked Wednesday as he flew from Los Angeles to Miami International Airport. He was taken into custody at a motel shortly after he arrived.

Although the U.S. does not require citizens of New Zealand to obtain visas to enter the country, they must obtain visas to study or work.  Goldman said there was no evidence Saffi was connected to any terrorism group. Federal agents and published reports say he is Hussein\\'s stepson, but Saffi denied any family tie to the Iraqi leader yesterday.  Last night, Saffi was taken to a detention facility, where he will remain pending a deportation hearing.  FBI Special Agent Judy Orihuela said Saffi flew from New Zealand to Los Angeles yesterday.

The president was to announce his executive order, which he signed yesterday, during an Independence Day celebration honoring veterans in Ripley, W.Va.  \"Our fine service men and women are fighting and winning the war on terror. They deserve the gratitude of all people who cherish freedom,\" Bush said in a formal holiday statement.  A White House paper outlining the change to immigration policy described it as a way to reward noncitizen personnel serving in active duty during the post-Sept. 11 war on terrorism. Citizenship, in turn, will improve the retention of military personnel by allowing them to advance their military careers, the White House said.  While legal permanent residency is all that is required to enlist in the U.S. military, only citizens can be promoted to commissioned or warrant officers, or serve in special warfare programs such as the Navy SEALs.  It will take 10 years and at least $ 2.4 billion to sort out more than a century\\'s worth of transactions from a mismanaged trust fund system handling royalties from Indian-owned land, Interior Department officials said.

       " 'IMM-12156  PRIMARY  SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR CASE CENTERED ON RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS  * Jailing of lawbreakers without bail before deportation hearings is at issue.  The Supreme Court jumped into the debate over the rights and treatment of immigrants who break the law when it agreed Friday to hear a case with added resonance since the government began detaining foreigners in terrorism investigations.  The action came in the court\\'s final day of business before breaking for the summer. The court said it will decide if the government can jail foreign criminals without bail pending a deportation hearing. Prosecutors have lost several constitutional challenges to such detentions in federal court.  The issue predates Sept. 11 and the subsequent roundup and detention of possible terrorism suspects but raises some of the same civil liberties questions posed on behalf of immigrants recently held on secret charges.  Separately Friday, the court temporarily blocked a judge from opening secret detention or deportation hearings for those picked up since Sept. 11. The court acted at the request of the Bush administration, which argued that national security would be damaged by allowing reporters to attend.  Civil rights and media organizations are seeking names and other information on an unknown number of foreign nationals held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service since Sept. 11.  \"If these proceedings are opened to the public during the critical phase of the urgent threat to national security, terrorist organizations will have direct access to information about the government\\'s ongoing investigation,\" says a court filing from Theodore Olson, the top Supreme Court lawyer for President George W.

       " 'IMM-12158  PRIMARY  Court Allows Closed Immigration Hearings to Continue  The government may continue to hold secret immigration hearings for people detained in its anti-terror dragnet while an appellate court determines whether the policy is legal, the Supreme Court said yesterday.  In its first decision on a matter related to the Sept. 11 attacks, the high court blocked an order to immediately open the hearings. That order was issued last month by a federal judge who had ruled that the closed hearings were unconstitutional.  The Justice Department has appealed the decision, arguing that the issue touches \"on the nation\\'s very ability to defend itself against the continuing threat of hostile attack.\"  The Justice Department has refused to disclose how many secret hearings are scheduled or have already been held, but immigrant rights advocates estimate that they number in the hundreds.  Because the justices merely issued a brief order allowing the sealed hearings to continue, legal experts said it is impossible to assess the Supreme Court\\'s view of the case. Many expect the high court to ultimately decide the issue after the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the matter.  \"This was about keeping the barn door closed while we wait and see whether we have to decide to open it,\" said Erik S. Jaffe, an appellate attorney in the District.  Still, the ruling was a blow to civil liberties advocates who have challenged the legality of the hearings since the nation\\'s chief immigration judge, Michael J. Creppy, acting on behalf of Attorney General John D. Ashcroft, issued a blanket security directive 10 days after the Sept. 11 attacks for cases deemed of \"special interest\" to the terrorism investigation.  ',\n",

And thanks to international communication, the United States' reputation as a producer of everything in abundance is well-known throughout the world.  Meanwhile, the gap between the developed and developing world steadily grows, which encourages more and more emigration to the United States.  The resulting loss of human resources is a problem for our next-door neighbor, Mexico, and for the United States, which has to accommodate new immigrants. As an employee of the U.S. Foreign Service, I spent 42 years in Latin America, closely observing this phenomenon. Now, it seems the United States has the advantage.  Not all immigrants from Mexico are unskilled workers. Having little command of English, they sometimes find it difficult to prove their skills and capacities when trying to cross the border, poorly dressed and looking like common laborers. But those with training and professional expertise represent a brain drain for Mexico: That country loses public and private-sector investments in the human resources necessary to achieve enough progress to discourage emigration.  On the U.S. end, if immigration must be controlled, quality - not quantity - should be the determining factor. Instead of building fences at the border, we should have people there to test the incoming immigrants. Decisions on whether to allow them to stay should be based on whether they have something to contribute.  \",\n",

The immigrant is named Adel Tobbichi in court documents here but Dutch authorities say his name is Amine Mezbar, of Constantine, Algeria, and that he used two other aliases, Mathieu Miljadi Prajasemita and J. P. D. Straebler.  According to a Canadian prosecutor, James Brunton, the police discovered several forgeries during a search of his residence in Montreal, where he arrived in August 2001 with his wife, Faiza Bennouna. Ms. Bennouna returned to her native Netherlands three weeks before Mr. Tobbichi\\'s arrest on June 21.  The charges pending in Rotterdam include \"preparations for terrorist attacks\" and \"membership in a criminal organization.\" He is also charged with forging passports and other travel documents, conspiracy to cause an explosion, conspiracy to murder and possession of firearms.  The thick Dutch affidavit also provides circumstantial evidence linking Mr. Tobbichi with acetone, sulphuric acid and other bomb-making materials seized by the police.  It also says that he lived with two others arrested in the plot, Jerome Courtailler and Abdelghani Rabia.  A search of their residence by the Rotterdam police produced some 60 passports, as well as videos of Osama bin Laden and information on land mines.

The nation's approach to foreigners was a hodgepodge of contradiction, political contortion and irrational lawmaking before Sept. 11. It continues to deteriorate as government tightens borders and flails wildly against terrorism. Anecdotes from the past week describe best the nation's schizophrenic state of mind about immigrants.  Start with the scene Tuesday, a mile offshore, just south of Key Largo. Officers on a Coast Guard vessel spotted eight Cuban men on a 12-foot aluminum boat with a 26-horsepower engine. As authorities approached, five of the men jumped into the water - several donning fins and snorkel masks.  The swimming preparations were critical. Three of the men made it to shore and to freedom. The government will allow their release and permit them to stay here. Cuban migrants - only Cuban migrants - are granted asylum if they reach U.S. soil. The Coast Guard intercepted the other five men at sea, and they face an uncertain future - possibly including return to the island.  U.S. policy toward Cuban immigration would seem to be based on recruiting elite swimmers. Actually, it stems from language in 1994 and '95 agreements with Cuba, popularly known as the wet-foot, dry-foot policy. The five men caught in the water could not close the deal with a strong freestyle kick. It is a failure that U.S. policy does not tolerate.  \",\n",

He plans to offer an amendment in committee today that would give states more flexibility to offer federal health benefits to legal immigrant pregnant women and children. His plan makes good sense, in both human and financial terms, and should be supported by his colleagues in the U.S. Senate.  The original welfare-reform law imposed harsh and broad restrictions on federal public assistance for legal immigrants. Though Congress has since restored some benefits, legal immigrants arriving after 1996 remain ineligible for most federal benefits - including health care for pregnant women and children - during their first five years in this country.  Like many states, Florida has stepped in with substitute benefits, including immunizations and regular checkups, for some immigrant children. But its $13.5-million state program is limited, with capped enrollment. While it currently covers 16,000 children, more than 22,000 are on a waiting list, one that is growing by the day.  By relaxing federal restrictions, Graham's amendment would end these waiting lists and give immigrant expectant mothers and children the health care they need and deserve. With Florida's immigrant population on the rise, Graham's office estimates that his amendment would authorize coverage, under the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs, for some 100,000 additional immigrants now going without.  Here is one of the biggest of many reasons why that would be money well-spent: Children born here to legal immigrants are U.S. citizens, automatically eligible for the benefits and social services afforded to every citizen. With prenatal and early health care, those children stand a much better chance of growing up to lead healthy and productive lives, with little need for state intervention or support.  \",\n",

The computerized system, if it is up and running on schedule, would embody the most comprehensive change since Sept. 11 to the way the nation manages its millions of foreign visitors.  The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or Sevis, will rely largely on schools to monitor foreign students and to enter updated information about them into a national database.  Under Sevis, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, long faulted for its failure to manage the mounds of paper it collects on foreign students, would be better equipped to determine who actually entered the country, where they were supposed to be studying, whether they failed to study full time and if they dropped out of school.  But the schools that can enroll foreigners are a mixed lot, ranging from major universities to small language institutes, flight schools and beauty colleges.

The Commission on Immigration Reform issued a report last year on illegal immigration and will release its second report, on legal migrants, tomorrow. These two reports outline a rational set of principles that will restore credibility to our policies while setting priorities for the future.  Legitimate concern about weaknesses in our immigration policy should not, however, obfuscate what remains the essential point: the United States has been and should continue to be a nation of immigrants. A well-regulated system of legal immigration is in our national interest.  There have always been those who despised the newcomers. The history of American immigration policy is full of racism and ethnic prejudice. The Know-Nothings. The Chinese Exclusion Acts.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service recently embraced the issue, making this the second country, after Canada, to include abuse of women as possible grounds for granting political asylum. But in both legal cases, the INS argued in court against the women\\'s claims. And 10 days ago, INS lawyers appealed the Arlington ruling, saying the woman was not credible and the judge had \"abused his discretion.\"  Human rights groups, while hailing the Arlington ruling as a breakthrough for foreign-born victims of female genital mutilation, expressed dismay at the INS\\'s opposition to the women\\'s claims, especially in light of the agency\\'s high-profile efforts to make its staff aware of such abuse.

Surrounded by bodyguards, he was an imposing presence with his 6-foot-4 frame, his booming voice and his signature cowboy boots shining under the TV lights.  But behind the facade of power, Fox was a wounded man.  In February, the Mexican Congress, controlled by the opposition, dealt him a humiliating blow by barring him from traveling outside the country.  He was going away far too often, they said, and was using those trips to boost his international stature at the expense of domestic issues.  That\\'s why, when the National Association of Hispanic Journalists invited him to be the opening act for its 20th annual convention, instead of going to San Diego, where the event took place last week, he invited the 1,500 U.S. journalists attending the event to cross the border.  For a full hour, he answered their questions.  Some people were impressed.  \"Fox is a 21st century politician,\" said John Garcia, a TV journalist from New York. \"He looks good, answers the questions with sound bites, and has an open manner about him.\"  But others saw him as more of the same old-style politico who is keeping alive the long-lived tradition of talking a lot while saying very little.  Many of us in the audience that evening were disappointed. We had expected he would say something new about issues such as his running dispute with Cuban President Fidel Castro, human rights in Mexico or, even better, would take the opportunity to talk clearly about the state of immigration negotiations with Washington, a question as important for the U.S. as it is for Mexico.

Rasha Yaqoub, a student at Georgia State University, said she was detained Monday for more than an hour at Hartsfield simply because she\\'s from Yemen, a largely Muslim country in the Middle East.  Yaqoub said she was treated poorly by immigration and customs officials, was never told why she was being held and felt humiliated and threatened.  She wants an official apology from airport officials.  \"They shouldn\\'t profile or search certain races,\" Yaqoub, 24, said in an interview at her downtown Atlanta apartment. \"Not all of the people are the same.

(Customs officials in Atlanta, Miami and Washington couldn\\'t be reached for comment Thursday.) They deny that they single out people based on race.  Immigration and customs officers at Hartsfield are simply following a directive from Washington, issued last Friday, which compels them to more readily question Yemenis and search their baggage.

In the 55 years since then, the Mexico City native forgot about the money, became a U.S. citizen and raised a family in Hollister.  But now, at 81, he and thousands of other former Mexican \"guest workers\" who say they were denied a portion of their wages want their money. At the very least, they want their day in court.  \"Is it live or die? No,\" Ortiz said Wednesday in Washington. \"It\\'s the principle.\"  The Justice Department, in court papers, says the claim is too old and is trying to get a federal judge to dismiss a class-action lawsuit alleging hundreds of thousands of Mexicans who worked in America between 1942 and 1949 never received money deducted from their wages.  Legislation introduced Wednesday in Congress would prevent the government from having the suit dismissed on procedural grounds.  Ortiz was one of nearly 5 million Mexican guest workers recruited to the United States between 1942 and 1964 to harvest crops and maintain railroad tracks. The bracero program -- the name was taken from the Spanish for \"arm\" -- was launched during World War II to help fill jobs left vacant by U.S. workers called to fight.  In an unusual agreement between the U.S. and Mexican governments, the braceros had 10 percent of their wages deducted and sent, via Wells Fargo, to Mexican banks to serve as savings accounts. The agreement was supposed to serve as an incentive for the workers to return to Mexico once their contracts expired.  ',\n",

Weeks ago, they might have asked him to mop the floor, but those days are over.  \"Congratulations,\" one of them said. When one worker looked puzzled and asked what the hullabaloo was all about, another one said, \"He\\'s graduating this week . . . from this school.\"  Not just graduating, but graduating magna cum laude with a degree in computer science and mathematics -- and on Saturday, only two days after his 34th birthday. Not a bad birthday gift for the former campus janitor and illegal immigrant.  \"I\\'m sometimes surprised by the attention,\" Rubalcava said.  As America casts a suspicious eye toward immigrants after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, this soft-spoken man with bright eyes under droopy eyelids is a quiet reminder of the millions of newcomers who did good things before him and could do well after him.  Jumps the border  I first wrote about Rubalcava in 1998. He recently had enrolled at Santa Clara through a reduced-tuition program for employees, four years after arriving at the Jesuit school to clean offices, classrooms and toilets, and 17 years after jumping the border from his native Mexico to pick fruit in Gilroy.  He since has become a U.S. citizen and somewhat of a hero to Silicon Valley\\'s janitors, many of them Latino immigrants.

Most of them can\\'t.  The federal government gives visas that let foreign nationals come to the United States for a specific job, but it has no visa category that would cover the thousands of illegal immigrants in low-wage jobs around Georgia.  \"The people don\\'t have papers because there are no papers for these kinds of jobs,\" said Remedios Gomez Arnau, consul general of Mexico in Georgia and neighboring states.  President Bush and other politicians were pushing last year to let U.S. companies legally import immigrant workers, but momentum fizzled after Sept. 11.  The government has visas for unskilled agricultural workers, called H-2A visas. Several Georgia farmers get them to bring in Latino immigrants to help harvest the Vidalia onion and other crops.  Another kind of visas for unskilled workers, called an H-2B visa, often is used for jobs in forestry. It\\'s unsuitable for jobs in the construction, landscaping, poultry and carpet industries, which attract thousands of illegal immigrants, Gomez said, because the visas are temporary and hard to get.  Estimates of the illegal immigrant population in Georgia vary. Some immigrant advocates put the number around 250,000.  Federal law says U.S. companies can\\'t knowingly hire illegal immigrants and that illegal immigrants can\\'t legally work, but Gomez said the reality is quite different. The Immigration and Naturalization Service rarely fines businesses for employing illegal immigrants, and academics say economies all over the Southeast have come to rely on the labor of illegal immigrants.

Immigration Judge John M. Bryant said Tuesday that he will grant Flaubert Mbongo asylum in August, after the FBI conducts mandatory fingerprint checks.  Until 18 months ago, Justice Department officials refused to look at documents Mbongo said showed that his life was in danger in Cameroon because he tried to promote an opposition political party. The officials changed their stance after a Mercury News report in December 2000 confirmed that the documents were authentic and that Mbongo was telling the truth.  Mbongo\\'s victory comes as the chances of winning asylum have grown more difficult in the wake of Sept. 11. Elisa Massimino, head of the Washington office of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said that she feared that with new regulations being pushed by the Justice Department, \"If this case happened today, under the new regulations, there is a greater risk that it would have been sent back home before anyone ever looked at his documents and gave him the chance to adjudicate his case.\"  First asylum request  When Bryant first heard Mbongo\\'s request for asylum in March 1997, Mbongo was brought into court in shackles and told his story in French, through an interpreter.

The alleged scheme exploited loopholes in the INS\\'s Transit Without Visa Program, in which arriving international passengers en route to a third country can stop briefly in the United States while connecting to other flights. The program has come under scrutiny since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks focused attention on the weaknesses of existing controls at U.S. airports, borders and seaports.  Authorities cited no known link to terrorism in the Los Angeles Airport case -- merely a highly profitable scheme in which people with no legal way to enter the United States paid up to $10,000 apiece.  Future of program  INS officials initially considered shutting down the Transit Without Visa Program in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks but are now considering less drastic changes, such as limiting the number of airports using it and expanding the list of countries whose nationals are barred from no-visa transit travel.  More than 1 million foreigners lacking U.S. visas pass through the United States each year as transit passengers en route to other countries.  \"It\\'s a program that needs to be looked at because there are loopholes in it,\" said Andrew Cowan, an assistant U.S. attorney who is handling the case against Maximiano R.

The current percentage is the highest it has been  since 1930, the year that marked the end of a great wave of  migration and signaled the start of a long period of relatively  low immigration.  The reason these numbers need to be examined  against earlier periods is that this time there is no pause in  sight.

Those duties are performed exclusively now by 2,000 agents for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  While Kennett Square police say they support the concept, Philadelphia police and others say they fear that it will overburden their departments and make immigrants less likely to report crimes.

Key elements of the federal government\\'s new strategy include deployment of hovercraft and horseback units to patrol the All American Canal, stepped up helicopter surveillance, extended testing of non-lethal pepper ball launchers, and installation of six \"rescue beacons\" in the desert outside Yuma, Ariz.  The beacons are 30-foot-tall towers designed to emit a distress signal and are capped with strobe lights that can be spotted five miles away.  A metal plate posted at the base advises migrants in English and Spanish: \"If you need help, push red button. U.S. Border Patrol will arrive in 1 hour. Do not leave this location.\"  Many of the measures will target the Imperial Valley, a region crisscrossed by irrigation waterways including the swift-moving All American Canal, where 17 people have drowned since Oct. 1.

       " 'IMM-12361  PRIMARY  APPEAL BOARD REVERSES DECISION ON DEPORTATIONS BASED ON DUI CONVICTIONS  A little-known federal appeal board has reversed its own ruling on whether aliens can be deported for drunken driving. As a result, it appears that an Irishman with three felony DUI convictions in Missouri may stay here.  The Board of Immigration Appeals ruled April 4 in a case from Massachusetts that driving under the influence does not constitute a crime of violence and is therefore not grounds for deportation. The board reviews decisions made by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Before that ruling, the Justice Department argued in a case in the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis that Frank P. Byrne should be deported. Now, the department wants the Board of Immigration Appeals to take a look.  \"It\\'s just a matter of time before the Board of Immigration Appeals terminates the case,\" said Byrne\\'s attorney, Tim Wichmer of Clayton. \"It\\'s a win, a total win.\"  The INS released Byrne from custody in St. Louis on April 18. Byrne is on parole from his state prison sentence and living in Kansas City.  Byrne, 41, said that during the case INS officials promised him legal documents so he could pursue his appeal, but then failed to provide them. \"I felt like they were pounding me into giving up the opportunity to fight,\" he said.  Heather Phillips, an attorney for the Justice Department, said that depending on a review of how Byrne\\'s case fits with the Massachusetts decision, he still might be deported.  ',\n",

Further, the Family Reunification Act sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) still allows some convicted, deported felons to return to the United States. Perhaps they can reside at Frank\\'s house upon re-entrance.  Here are the facts: First, safety of Americans is the goal of national security, not convenience and comfort for people who are not even supposed to be here.  And second, \"illegal, undocumented, unnaturalized\" all mean \"unlawful,\" and if entrance is obtained illegally, why should any lawful standard be lowered to meet the crime? Illegal entry should equal automatic deportation. GALE NORBY, Buford  Legislation a welcome improvement  Upon reading the editorial on immigrants needing leeway, I was very impressed with the opinion of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about a lot of my brother immigrants (\"Immigrants deserve wiggle room,\" @issue, May 14). It was very sad that a lot of our Hispanic brothers who are illegally in this country were being affected, or in fact targeted, for things that a different type of sick individuals did to this country.  I am sure that passing a bill to give immigrants more time to apply for legal status would prove to a lot of Americans that Hispanics as a whole are here to help this great nation, in every field, including eradicating sick people such as the murderers of Sept. 11.

Yet refugees continue to arrive in the United States at a slow pace, despite a pledge by President Bush in November to admit 70,000.  As of March 31, the U.S. government had admitted 8,093 refugees. By this time last year, 31,549 refugees had been resettled in the United States.  Although tourists and students continued to enter the country, refugee admissions to the United States ceased following Sept. 11. In fact, refugees were the only immigrants restricted from entering the country until President Bush lifted the moratorium on Nov. 11.  If a terrorist wanted to enter the country, he would not do so as a refugee. In addition to new U.S. security measures that require all refugees to be photographed and fingerprinted, refugees undergo a thorough interview and background check that can take five years.  None of the alleged Sept. 11 hijackers came into the country through the refugee program.  Why were refugees singled out? Perhaps the answer lies in the steadily declining number of refugees admitted annually over the past 10 years. Bush's pledge to admit 70,000 pales in comparison with the early '90s, when annual admissions were in the range of 150,000.  Even in 1993, the number of refugees admitted exceeded 100,000. In that year, President Clinton authorized 132,000 refugee admissions.  \",\n",

Over the last year and a half, versions of the legislation have passed twice in the House and once in the Senate.  The legislation was attacked by opponents as an amnesty in disguise and supported by proponents as a modest measure to help keep hard-working immigrant families together in the United States. While broader reforms were broached last year by the Bush administration, this legislation was the only significant measure easing immigration rules to reach a floor vote in this Congress.  But advocates and foes alike say the push to grant protections to a narrowly defined group of illegal immigrants stalled after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, caused the government to rethink the connections between immigration policy and national security.  \"Had it not been for Sept. 11,\" said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that favors restrictions, the legislation \"probably would have gone through.\" Now, he said, the proposal \"is pretty much dead for the remainder of this session of Congress.\"  ',\n",

It is the first new passenger terminal to be built at the airport in more than 25 years.  Port Authority officials said the terminal will create 800 to 1,000 jobs.  In 1991, the four foreign carriers formed a consortium, Terminal One Group Association, that proposed the idea to the Port Authority, which runs the airport. The agency negotiated financing of the multi-million-dollar project and terms of a 30-year lease.  The project was financed through the New York City Industrial Development Agency.

Chang Ping Lin, 34, was found guilty of kidnapping, conspiracy to kidnap, making extortionate extensions of credit, and collecting extensions of credit by extortion.  Lin, an undocumented immigrant under detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, could face life in prison and $1 million in fines or deportation back to China. His sentencing was set for Jan. 17.  After the verdict, Deputy U.S. Attorney Lee A.

The 2-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in an appeal out of New Jersey, runs counter to an August decision on the same issue by the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, and thus provides context and a reason for review by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Third and Sixth Circuits have now offered different takes on balancing the rights of immigrants facing deportation, public access to legal proceedings, and the government\\'s need for secrecy to fight international terrorism.

Virginia lawmakers have asked DMV officials to study the issue and report back to them by the beginning of next year, when the legislative session begins in Richmond. The agency's findings could go a long way toward determining whether legislation is needed that would tie getting a license to having legal immigrant status.  So far, the DMV has not taken a position, said spokeswoman Pam Goheen. But she said the agency has learned that the stakes are high on both sides.  Immigration advocacy groups contend that prohibiting undocumented immigrants from obtaining licenses would devastate millions of families who are already in the country, making it hard for them to get work or even cash a check. Many would drive to jobs anyway and would not be able to buy auto insurance, the advocates say.  But proponents of a ban, including several state lawmakers, say protecting the United States from terrorist attack justifies whatever hardship those families would endure. Seven of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks had obtained Virginia ID cards or licenses illegally, they point out.  Since the attacks, Virginia has closed several loopholes in its licensing regulations. The state no longer accepts notarized identity and residency affidavits, nor will it accept passports with expired visas, which had been popular methods of obtaining a license before Sept. 11. The DMV also rejects I-94 forms, immigration documents that attest to one's legal resident status, as proof of identity.  \",\n",
       " 'IMM-12534  PRIMARY  More Than an Academic Exercise  The Sept. 11 hijackers, it was recently revealed, code-named the Pentagon \"the Faculty of Fine Arts\" and the twin towers \"the Faculty of Urban Planning.\" An Internet message from one plotter spoke of \"19 certificates for private study and four exams,\" and ended, \"Regards to the professor.\"  The idea that the terrorists of Al Qaeda hid behind a veil of studies is both appalling and familiar. Who can forget the Iranian \"students\" of 1979 who held our Tehran embassy hostage? But the fact that enemies sometimes assume the guise of students should not be a signal to crack down on foreigners who genuinely want to study here. New regulations aimed at improving the screening of visa seekers have forced tens of thousands of foreigners already here to return home and reapply for student visas. Many have been waiting months for permission to come back.  The new policy requires that officials in Washington approve visas for every male between the ages of 16 and 45 who is a native of any one of 26 countries. This has led to a dramatic drop in the number of visa applications by genuine students from Arab countries, and interminable delays for those who try to see the process through. Most of these applicants are precisely the people who can help combat militant Islam in their own countries.  There is no question that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been dysfunctional and that closer I.N.S. scrutiny of applicants and tracking of foreigners by their host institutions are necessary. But the failure to halt the Sept. 11 attack was one of intelligence, not visa processing. Since almost none of the 19 hijackers had a history of terrorist activity, the new screening process would not have stopped them.  ',\n",

In the article regarding the Lake Worth ordinance (\"Mexican IDs unlikely to win Lake Worth nod,\" Tuesday), an illegal immigrant stated that the Mexican consular document would not make her life easier, since she still is in this country illegally. Did she have a right to enter this country unlawfully and remain here because (she says) her visa request was \"ignored,\" and should she expect no repercussions? The immigration process is not a McDonald\\'s drive-through.  There is little distinction between an individual entering this country illegally and someone breaking into a home. Immigrants of all nationalities do contribute much to this country\\'s economy and social fabric, and make it a better place, but the immigration must be in accordance with our laws. Rewarding or accommodating illegal immigrants is an affront to the millions of immigrants who played by the rules. Ordinances like this only encourage foreign nationals to sneak across the border and disrespect the laws of this nation.  MARK and  DEBBIE HATCHER  Lake Worth  ',\n",

Jee were inundated with calls for help when the landmark welfare law took effect six years ago.  The law, which prohibited legal immigrants from receiving assistance, hit metro Atlanta Asians hard. There was no safety net to catch them.  \"A lot of people came to us crying,\" recalled Connie Jee. \"A lot of immigrants couldn\\'t get food stamps, no assistance. They came to us, so we opened a food bank.\"  Their plight inspired Henry Jee --- Korean activist, businessman and ordained Southern Baptist minister --- to form the Asian-American Center. The nonprofit opened in Lilburn, helping the needy with everything from food to health care and overcoming language barriers.  Now, the 5-year-old center needs a bailing out.  Henry Jee, 64, died of a heart attack two months ago.  He, perhaps more than anybody else, embraced the center\\'s mission. He solicited donations from corporate giants like UPS and Coca-Cola. He applied for grants and did whatever was necessary --- including drawing money off family credit cards --- to keep the center afloat.  Jee\\'s death, coupled with less-generous donations after Sept. 11, has weakened the financial health of the agency. But Connie Jee doesn\\'t want to shut the facility down.

       " \"IMM-12562  PRIMARY  SECURITY SCAPEGOATS  Federal agents simultaneously swept through South Florida's three major airports this month and arrested 29 custodial workers, nearly all of them Hispanics, on charges of falsifying immigration documents and Social Security numbers on job applications.  At Palm Beach International Airport, Border Patrol agents put 14 workers in handcuffs and marched them to the Palm Beach County Jail. At Fort Lauderdale and Miami airports, agents arrested and jailed 15. Those witnessing the scene had reason to assume the government had struck a mighty blow against dangerous terrorists. In fact, the offenders were hard-working immigrants who took difficult, menial jobs no one else wanted. They mopped restrooms, dumped trash and swept hallways.  Because some of them cleaned airplanes and had access to restricted areas, their arrests raised questions about how the airports screen employees. If these workers found it this easy to get clearance, couldn't real terrorists do it, too? All the money spent on upgrading security with new equipment, personnel and procedures means little if there is no safeguard against a lie that opens doors to sensitive places. Airport officials have to do better at checking the backgrounds of employees to prevent penetration of the system from within.  The arrests also expose our national failure to deal with immigration issues without hypocrisy. Americans still depend on immigrant workers - most of them Hispanics - to fill the bottom rungs on the economic ladder. Lawmakers decry the presence of illegals while depending on them to make the beds in their hotel rooms, mow their lawns and pick the tomatoes for their salads. The nation continues to send a mixed message to foreigners: We do not want you to come here illegally, yet if you do, there's a job waiting for you. The government needs to establish legal routes for workers to cross the border, and employers must participate in the system instead of circumventing it.  \",\n",
       " 'IMM-12563  PRIMARY  INS unlikely to meet student-tracking deadline  Washington --- The government may miss a Jan. 30 deadline to establish a system for tracking foreign college students, federal officials warned Wednesday.  Janis Sposato, deputy commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, told a House subcommittee that her agency had made \"considerable progress\" on the Internet-based system to monitor more than 500,000 foreigners who study at the U.S. colleges and trade schools each year.  She conceded, however, that the INS was still struggling to write regulations for the program. She also said it is uncertain whether inspectors could visit all of the participating schools to verify that they are legitimate educational institutions.  Congress ordered the agency to set up the $37 million monitoring system by next Jan. 30 after it was discovered that three of the Sept. 11 hijackers had student visas. Two had visas for pilot training and a third for English language classes.  The tracking system requires schools to enter information about each foreign student and to notify the government if one fails to appear for classes.  Glenn Fine, the inspector general for the Justice Department, raised doubts about how complete the new system will be. \"We continue to believe that full implementation is unlikely by Jan. 30, 2003,\" he told the congressional committee.  The INS database on the thousands of participating schools is filled with inaccuracies, Fine said. He said his office checked out 200 of the schools and found that 86 appeared to have closed and, among the rest, 56 were listed with incorrect addresses or names.  ',\n",

But, as the Census Bureau indicated last week, they keep coming.  In a report that stunned some demographers, the bureau said that foreign-born residents -- immigrants, refugees and undocumented aliens -- made up 8.8 per cent of the population, a post-World War II record. Researchers said the increase is explained partly by declining birth rates among native-born Americans, and mainly by increased immigration.  Demographers say that the proportion of foreign born is nowhere near the 14.7 per cent figure reached in 1910. Still, it is double what it was in 1970 and has accelerated in the last four years.  The Census Bureau report comes as immigration -- legal and illegal -- is becoming a central political issue. Candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination like Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Pat Buchanan have made curbing it a pivotal part of their campaigns and a number of proposals in Congress are aimed at halting the flow from abroad.

Here in Freeport, in Nassau County, a new hiring site opened this morning with the help of a $20,000 grant from the village\\'s Community Development Agency. But in the hamlet of East Farmingdale, in Suffolk County, a similar hiring site is facing eviction after just a month in operation because the management company that rented it space says it is violating the law.  The contrasting fates of the two hiring sites have once again thrown into sharp relief the debate about immigrant day laborers, many of whom spend their mornings on street corners or outside convenience stores, waiting for contractors offering a day of work, say, landscaping lawns or clearing debris.  Some residents and politicians have embraced hiring sites -- lots, buildings or trailers that are designated as places where workers and employers can meet each day -- as safer, more convenient alternatives to the informal gathering spots. But in other places, residents and officials have fought the sites on grounds that it is illegal to play matchmaker between undocumented workers and those who want to hire them.  \"One had very clear government support, and the other didn\\'t,\" Edward Hernandez, a spokesman for the Long Island Immigrant Alliance, said in explaining why the Freeport site is apparently poised to thrive even as the East Farmingdale site is in jeopardy.

The issue concerns not only the uneasy balancing of the rights of immigrants facing deportation, but also public access to legal proceedings and the government\\'s need for secrecy to fight international terrorism.  In a case destined for the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Circuit Judge Edward R. Becker, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, told lawyers that he and his two colleagues understood the case\\'s national significance and would decide it \"as quickly as humanly possible.\"  Becker\\'s statement likely means a decision in weeks, rather than the months the Third Circuit typically takes in deciding appeals.  \"Society has an overwhelming interest in knowing when the government detains individuals who have lived in this country for years, holds them in some cases for months on end, and then deports them,\" Lee Galernt, a lawyer with the ACLU\\'s Immigrants\\' Rights Project in New York, told the judges.

Eleven years later, another newcomer, Matias Lara, got lost wandering the streets of Chicago.  Both eventually emerged from their travails safe and sound - and offered up their thanks in the form of retablos, simple votive paintings on tin. Their expressions of religious faith are on view at the University of Pennsylvania Museum in a show called \"Miracles on the Border: Folk Paintings of Mexican Migrants to the United States.\"  This is a modest show of 50 colorful 20th-century retablos, some painted by immigrants or family members, others by commissioned folk artists. The latter, as one would expect, tend to be more sophisticated. All were collected by Douglas Massey, the Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor of Sociology at Penn, and Jorge Durand, a visiting professor at Penn\\'s Population Studies Center.  The retablos have a conventional form: In general, they combine a short Spanish-language text with a rendering of both the real-life incident that inspired the retablo and of the Virgin Mary, a crucified Christ or a particular saint. (Ramirez\\'s retablo, for example, includes a picture of him lying on the railroad tracks.) In some retablos, the subjects of the presumed miracle are pictured on their knees, praying.  This nicely laid-out exhibition provides both a brief history of retablos and English translations of the texts, which most commonly celebrate recoveries from illness, survival of accidents, and successful border crossings. They include the testimony of both legal and illegal immigrants, and attest to the hopes and anxieties of both groups.  ',\n",

Tom Tancredo's decision to ask federal immigration agents to  deport an Aurora honor student has touched a national nerve, one  that reaches back to the blaring contradictions of the country's  chaotic immigration system, experts say.  By law, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is required to  round up the estimated 8 million undocumented residents who live in  the United States. But by Supreme Court decree, undocumented  children have a right to a free public education through high  school.  It isn't illegal for Colorado universities to admit undocumented  students, but it is illegal to give them financial aid or in-state  tuition.  Tancredo's decision to ask the INS to deport Jesus Apodaca, an  undocumented immigrant who spoke out last month about his struggle  to attend college, has touched both of those legal contradictions  and the frustration that results in both advocates and foes.  Since Tancredo's demand was first published in The Denver Post on  Friday, immigration officials in Denver have been flooded with  calls asking them not to deport Apodaca. The Mexican consulate has  received dozens of calls and e-mails condemning its support for the  student.  'I've been called a jerk.

The new procedures, intended to improve the monitoring of certain foreigners in the country, will apply to anyone arriving with a student, business or tourist visa who is believed to fit the criteria of a potential terrorist.  Justice Department officials said they would not disclose the criteria that the agents will use in determining who will be required to submit to fingerprinting, as well as photographing, for fear of jeopardizing intelligence-gathering.  Still, the widespread assumption among civil liberties groups and American Muslims is that visitors from Arab and Islamic nations will receive the closest scrutiny. Arab nations have drawn the same conclusion and the 22-member Arab League has denounced the new effort as discriminatory.  The new measures are supposed to go into effect on a trial basis at some points of entry on Wednesday and to be in operation at all points of entry by Oct. 1. The Justice Department would not say where the new monitoring will start this week.  Many Muslim visa applicants are already singled out for extra investigation before they leave home. In line with a post-Sept. 11 rule, applicants from 26 countries, a list that is dominated by Islamic nations, must be cleared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation before their requests are reviewed at American consulates.

In a case involving an American-born man picked up on the battlefields of Afghanistan, allegedly fighting for the Taliban, the Omaha-based Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement (FILE) is asking a federal court to review our presumptions about citizenship.  The group says Yaser Esam Hamdi, who was raised in Saudi Arabia to Saudi parents but was born in Louisiana where his father was working on temporary assignment as a chemical engineer, should not be considered a citizen simply by dint of his birth on American soil. Hamdi was transferred from Guantanamo to a floating Naval brig in Virginia when his citizenship was discovered. He is now asking a federal court in a habeas corpus action whether, as an American, he can be held as an enemy combatant without access to counsel or other due process. FILE is asking to intervene in the case in order to posit its theory that Hamdi is legally a Saudi citizen and should not be considered American.  It is easy to dismiss FILE\\'s claims as xenophobic hogwash until you look more closely at what the group is proposing.  The Constitution\\'s citizenship clause in the 14th Amendment states: \"(A)ll Persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The group says, despite popular belief, the history of this amendment makes clear it does not confer \"birthright citizenship.\"  ',\n",

As part of the Bush administration\\'s anti-terrorism efforts, the INS last spring proposed changing the default length of tourist visas from six months to 30 days. Visitors would be required to demonstrate a need for a longer visa, which could be issued for a \"fair and reasonable\" period to complete the purpose of the visit, according to INS officials.  The proposal would have a devastating effect on a wide range of tourism-related businesses, including the South Florida\\'s tourism-sensitive real estate market, Macaluso said.  Macaluso said the proposal already has scared away foreign investors looking at purchasing vacation or investment homes in the United States. Two prospective $2 million purchases in the Naples area recently fell through because of it, he said.  \"They didn\\'t feel they would be able to use their property,\" he said. \"Just the proposal has had a significant economic impact on the real estate market and certainly implementation would be more disastrous.\"  ',\n",
       " \"IMM-12658  PRIMARY  REMEMBER 9/11: Q&A ON IMMIGRATION: Changes mean more agents, tougher rules  Here's a look at some frequently asked questions and some answers, compiled by staff writer Mark Bixler, about the effect of Sept. 11 on immigration law:  Q: Why did Sept. 11 focus attention on immigration law?  A: The 19 terrorists who struck that day were foreign nationals who had entered the United States through legal channels. In response, the federal government has passed new immigration laws and tightened regulations. It's part of a larger effort to improve security by rewriting laws about aviation security, money laundering and intelligence gathering.  Q: How did the terrorists enter the United States?  A: They got visas from U.S. embassies or consulates in their native countries. Fifteen received tourist visas. Tourist visas typically are good for six months, though a proposal would shorten that time to 30 days. Three hijackers received visas by posing as businessmen. One got a student visa to study English in California, but never showed up for class.  Q: Does the government check the background of people applying for visas?  A: The State Department, which issues visas, uses a computer database to perform background checks with U.S. intelligence agencies. After the attacks, the department started asking more questions of men ages 16 to 45 seeking a visa. It asks about their military service, experience with weapons of mass destruction and affiliation with professional, social and charitable organizations. The State Department also plans to start checking the names of applicants against the names of wanted criminals in an FBI database.  \",\n",

They fueled suspicion about people crossing U.S. borders and sent authorities scurrying to tighten an immigration system that critics call ripe for exploitation.  When the nation marks the Sept. 11 anniversary next week, some of those who land on U.S. soil will be photographed and fingerprinted as soon as they step off their planes.  It\\'s the latest of dozens of changes --- some implemented, some proposed --- that subject immigrants to more scrutiny at a time when the United States and metro Atlanta have more foreign-born residents than ever before.  The changes, however, smack of too little, too late for people such as Betty Johnson, a Forest Park retiree.  \"If the Immigration and Naturalization Service did what it was supposed to do, then all this [the terrorist strike] might not have happened,\" she said.  Others say talk of tighter controls gives people a false sense of security.  \"If you\\'re talking about a sophisticated terrorist operation, I really think it would be rare that tighter immigration controls would identify him,\" said David Martin, a University of Virginia law professor and INS general counsel from 1995 to 1998.  Meanwhile, civil libertarians argue that some of the changes are unconstitutional. A federal appeals court agreed. It ruled Aug. 26 that the government could not hold secret deportation proceedings for immigrants detained in the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history.  ',\n",

But some commissioners balked at the idea.  \"I think it\\'s a backdoor way to legitimize illegal immigrants,\" said Commissioner Elaine Boyer. \"How do we know with the first anniversary of Sept. 11 coming that we are not accepting people with criminal backgrounds?\"  Commissioner Judy Yates, who said she used her passport as a form of identification when she lived in France, wondered why immigrants in DeKalb can\\'t do the same.  \"I just don\\'t see what we\\'re accomplishing here,\" she said.  County officials said some Mexicans who cannot open a bank account and thus carry large amounts of cash are often robbed.  Commissioners are scheduled to vote on the issue next Tuesday.  To get a card, Mexican nationals living in the United States must pay $29 and show a certified copy of their birth certificate and an official photo ID. They must also show proof of their U.S. address.  ',\n",

But the recent appointment of Francisco Antonio Pena Guaba, who had served as the Dominican secretary of youth and had before never lived in New York, has stirred discontent among relentlessly political Dominican immigrants.  It had become custom in recent years to name a resident of the New York region to the post. The official oversees consular services for the 800,000 Dominicans in New York and New Jersey, serving as their official link with the island. In previous years, nominees came from the local chapters of Dominican political parties, whose donations make New York a required stop in presidential campaigns.  \"People feel someone who has gone through the immigrant experience has a much better understanding of the day-to-day problems and concerns that the Dominican immigrant population has,\" said Anthony Stevens-Acevedo, a high school teacher in Washington Heights active in community causes.  The phenomenon has resulted in some strange career paths: one recent consul general had been a restaurant worker, another a building superintendent. Few, if any, had college degrees. By contrast, consuls general who represent Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador never come from the New York area and often have impressive resumes. (Mexico\\'s consul general, Salvador Beltran del Rio, was a member of the Mexican Congress and studied law at Harvard.)  ',\n",

The bill first landed on Davis\\' desk a year ago, but was withdrawn after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  Now, the administration is done talking about amendments that would require background checks before driver\\'s licenses could be issued to as many as 1 million of the state\\'s estimated 3 million undocumented immigrants, said spokesman Russ Lopez.  \"The governor believes the amendments are good as they are. The language is strong, and it\\'s necessary,\" Lopez said. \"We have come to the best middle ground on this.\"  Davis rejected immigration-reform advocates\\' argument that the state has no business licensing illegal residents, accepting the bill supporters\\' claim that it is better to have undocumented immigrants trained and insured because many would drive anyway. But he promised to veto the measure unless his amendments are added in a companion bill.  Another requirement  In addition to background checks, licenses should be limited to immigrants who have \"lived, worked and paid taxes in California for a substantial period of time,\" Davis said in a letter outlining his requirements.

The full text is available at nytimes.com/national.  The primary issue on appeal in this case is whether the First Amendment to the United States Constitution confers a public right of access to deportation hearings. If it does, then the government must make a showing to overcome that right.  No one will ever forget the egregious, deplorable and despicable terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. These were cowardly acts. In response, our government launched an extensive investigation into the attacks, future threats, conspiracies and attempts to come. As part of this effort, immigration laws are prosecuted with increased vigor. The issue before us today involves these efforts.  The political branches of our government enjoy near-unrestrained ability to control our borders. \"These are policy questions entrusted exclusively to the political branches of our government.\" Since the end of the 19th century, our government has enacted immigration laws banishing, or deporting, noncitizens because of their race and their beliefs.  While the Bill of Rights jealously protects citizens from such laws, it has never protected noncitizens facing deportation in the same way. In our democracy, based on checks and balances, neither the Bill of Rights nor the judiciary can second-guess government\\'s choices. The only safeguard on this extraordinary governmental power is the public, deputizing the press as the guardians of their liberty.  ',\n",

These are the fields of lost dreams for the nationals of more than 40 countries who, as unwanted aliens, are jailed within the whitewashed walls of Ullin\\'s Tri-County Detention Center.  The privately run jail is a low-rise, compact building with barred skylights, lockdown cells and fences topped with razor coils. Since last year\\'s terrorist attacks, its prisoner list appears to include more Arab and Muslim names than before Sept. 11.  Surrounding Pulaski County owns the jail, contracting it out to the U.S. Marshal\\'s Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS is Tri-County\\'s best customer. Most of the jail\\'s inmates are INS detainees, who were arrested in one of the three states that make up the Chicago district -- Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.  The past year has brought a bumper-crop of INS arrivals, compared to the previous three years since the jail opened in 1999, said Gil Walker, chairman and chief executive of GRW Corp., a Tennessee company that staffs and runs the jail.  \"Demand for service has increased since Sept. 11,\" he said.

Irish immigrants first began settling here in the mid-1980\\'s, and by 2000, the bars and sidewalks were teeming with young Irish people who had come for the jobs and the great craic, the Gaelic word for fun. The community seized claim to the unofficial title of Ireland\\'s 33rd county.  But as the American economy has flagged and jobs have grown scarce, many Irish have returned home to look for work.

Even though he had no country to go to after finishing his studies, even though his three daughters, now 13, 11 and 7, are American-born and his parents also are citizens, the Palestinian without a passport was denied asylum in May 1997. He then was imprisoned for 4 1/2 years - without ever being charged with a crime. His deportation last week was as inhumane as his almost routine solitary confinement.  In 1995, the FBI had raided a now-defunct Islamic think tank, the World and Islam Studies Enterprises, that Dr. Najjar helped to found at USF. A former member of WISE had resurfaced as head of the Palestinian terrorist group Islamic Jihad. So when the federal government first claimed to have secret evidence that Dr. Najjar had raised money for a terrorist organization, Immigration Judge R. Kevin McHugh denied bail.  But in this unconstitutional nightmare, the government never has allowed Dr. Najjar to confront the supposed evidence. In May 2000, after administrative appeals were exhausted, a federal trial court judge ruled in Dr. Najjar's habeas corpus lawsuit that he had been denied due process during his bail hearing three years earlier. Worse, at the immigration rehearing, Judge McHugh concluded from the government's summary of the evidence that Dr. Najjar was hardly a threat to national security.  \",\n",

Ziglar had been an investment banker and served as the Senate's sergeant at arms. He was also a childhood friend of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.). A good cocktail party guest perhaps, but not the right person to run an agency responsible for guarding 7,500 miles of border, checking half-a-billion people entering our country each year and processing millions of visas, residency and citizenship applications.  Since Sept. 11, the schizophrenic agency has improved little, if at all. Outdated methods of recording and tracking information, lopsided deployment of border guards, credential backlogs and inconsistent visa policies that result in the innocent being punished along with the guilty are problems that have only gotten worse. For example, a new database that is supposed to monitor foreign students remains on hold.  Ziglar should have quit months ago. Perhaps around the time the INS mailed posthumous visa renewals to two of the Sept. 11 hijackers - all 19 of whom, not incidentally, had been admitted to the U.S. on legal visas.  \",\n",

The gangs thrive on shoplifting and selling fake green cards, but they also are known to extort shop owners, deal drugs and protect prostitution rings, police said.  Their favorite exploit is barging into Baptisms, weddings and other Mexican family gatherings, where they threaten guests and steal alcohol.  One such raid early Sunday in the Bronx touched off gunfire that left a 10-year-old girl dead.  Police say these Mexican gangs are most active in Corona and Elmhurst in Queens, Parkchester in the Bronx and Sunset Park in Brooklyn.  \"The gangs are involved in assault, robbery, weapons possession and drug-related offenses,\" said Pat Clark, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney\\'s office, which prosecutes about 60 Mexican gang cases a year.  Gang members mark their territory on walls and signs across the city. In gang-infested Linden Park in Corona, the logo for the Crazy Homies has been carved in a tree trunk.  The gangs tend to prey on the city\\'s expanding Mexican population, which tripled to nearly 200,000 people during the past decade. They target illegal immigrants because many of them are afraid to call police, authorities said.  Much of the gang behavior is bravado. Gangs with names such as Sombra Negra, Black Shadow in English, and The Mexican Boys attack one another in fights over territory and superiority, authorities said. 30 crews Mexican gangs started springing up in the city more than a decade ago. Law enforcement agencies didn\\'t notice a proliferation until the mid-1990s, when they identified 11 Mexican gangs with nearly 600 members. NYPD gang experts estimate there are now as many as 30 Mexican gangs active in the city.  ',\n",

The rewrite, included in a broad bill that also tightened sanctions for illegal immigration, was stripped out by House members who asked for more time to study the more volatile issue of legal immigration.  In the Senate, Simpson, R-Wyo., had also combined legaland illegal-immigration proposals in one bill but saw them split two weeks ago in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee approved a bill addressing illegal immigration last week, and it will be sent to the full Senate next month with the separate legal-immigration measure.  \",\n",

Clinging to old tires, the illegal migrants and the men smuggling them waded silently past this dusty border town on a hot, windy afternoon. They had not gone far when Brad Dupre, a Border Patrol agent, drove by and spotted them.  \"You can bet another smuggler\\'s waiting for them,\" he said. He wheeled his truck up a bumpy road near the river. Then his radio crackled with an alert: A white pickup had ignored another agent\\'s order to stop. Dupre caught sight of it minutes later, but as soon as he pursued, the driver swerved into a ditch, dived into the river and disappeared. The migrants downstream had lost their ride.  \"Well, that one didn\\'t go like they planned,\" Dupre said.  Another day here in the desert badlands along the border, another chase. The cat-and-mouse game between federal agents and migrant smugglers from Mexico is old and never ends. But with security on the border tighter than ever this summer, the tactics of the smuggling gangs that most illegal migrants now rely on are becoming more desperate, ruthless and deadly.  In the past two months, more than 110 migrants who put their fate in smugglers\\' hands have perished along the border from California to Texas. They have succumbed to searing desert heat, frozen in mountain passes, drowned in rivers and canals, and crashed in vans trying to elude highway checkpoints.  ',\n",

The INS issued about 60,500 new H-1B visas in the first three quarters of its fiscal year, from Oct. 1, 2001, to June 30 -- a 54 percent drop from the 130,700 H-1B visas it issued in the same period of its previous fiscal year. There are 18,000 petitions pending, the INS said.  The plunge comes on the heels of a record year. Last year, Congress raised the annual cap on the visas to 195,000 and created exemptions for university researchers among others.  H-1B visas are good for up to six years and are popular in the tech industry for importing engineers. About half of H-1B visas go to people doing computer-related work, many of whom come from India and China. Tech companies such as Oracle, Intel and Hewlett-Packard are among the program\\'s biggest users.  Post-Sept. 11 scrutiny of visas and the reorganization of the Immigration and Naturalization Service have also likely played a role in the drop, said one immigration attorney.  \"Right now immigration is sort of in a mess,\" said Margaret Wong, a longtime immigration attorney in Cleveland. Wong said wait times for H-1B visas have increased from a month to 16 weeks.  Critics and supporters of the long-controversial H-1B program agree the drop is not surprising, but they interpret it differently.  ',\n",

More than 360 passenger screeners working at Mineta San Jose International Airport will be replaced in November when the federal government assumes control of security at 429 airports nationwide.  Many of the screeners are immigrants from the Philippines and are ineligible for the new jobs under the fledging Transportation Security Administration. By law, the screener positions can only be filled by citizens -- a requisite that has come under fire from civil rights and labor groups.  To help the screeners adapt to new jobs, a partnership between the city and other groups has created the center in a small building north of Terminal C. Officials said Thursday it was essential to place the center at the airport to make it easy for workers to visit it before or after their shifts.  The center will provide a range of services from helping immigrant workers file for citizenship -- a federal requirement for hiring -- to assisting in filing for unemployment benefits.  The effort is a cooperation among the city, Silicon Valley Workforce, a program that helps laid-off workers with job training, and the Philip Vera Cruz Justice Project, a group dedicated to protect the rights of Filipino immigrants.

He said the agency had been tipped off by a source several weeks ago that smugglers might try the novel approach, and he noted that the toilet, designed for handicapped individuals, was larger than standard ones.

Previously, a foreign worker who wanted to apply for permanent residency by filing form I-485, which is submitted by an individual, could not do so until his or her form I-140, which is usually filed by an employer, was approved.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service says the process has caused unnecessary delays for some foreign workers. A visa still needs to be available in order for the petitions to be processed.  If your I-140 was pending on July 31, you can file the I-485 with the appropriate fees and your I-140 receipt. Make sure to use form I-797.  If your current visa has expired and you want to work while your applications are pending, you can apply for employment authorization using form I-765. If you want to travel outside the United States while an application is being processed, you can apply to do so by using form I-131.  Changing your address  If you have a pending application and you have moved since you filed it, make sure to send your change of address to the INS.

The victims, young men ages 19 and 20, had made their way from Chiapas, in southernmost Mexico, before drowning in the canal's churning currents just 35 yards from United States land.  For the Imperial County Sheriff's Department, it was an ominous sign. The dead usually start showing up in multiples in high summer, when the desert becomes an inferno and the canal, roiling beneath a calm veneer, lures migrants looking for a quick way across and relief from the killing sun. If bodies were washing up in groups in March, what would the summer be like?  The answer, so far, is grim. Even though deaths along the Mexican border have declined over all as the slumping American economy has attracted fewer migrants, the toll is reaching record rates in the most remote and dangerous outposts. To avoid the stepped-up border patrols in populated areas, the most desperate migrants cross in the more unguarded and desolate deserts of Arizona and eastern California. June was the deadliest month ever for the southwest border, with 67 migrants dying, mostly in the unrelenting heat of the United States Border Patrol's Tucson sector, a barely habitable land that covers most of southern Arizona.  Here in the mountainous El Centro sector, which includes the vast Imperial Desert, 52 migrants have died since Oct. 1.

Immigrant advocates said that means some foreigners deported secretly after Sept. 11 might have been in compliance with laws they were expelled for breaking.  The government has not revealed previously the extent to which it has fallen behind in processing such records. Congressional investigators began an inquiry into the question after the terror attacks.  The documents have been collected by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from field offices around the country and sent to a warehouse complex outside Kansas City, Mo. They include 200,000 change-of-address notices, INS spokesman Bill Strassberger said.  Failure to file a change-of-address form is a deportable offense, and the Justice Department recently said it would step up enforcement.

Many Cubans came to Tampa long before Fidel Castro wrested control from dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Instead of coming for political reasons, they came for jobs.  The first Cuban migration to Tampa began in the late 1800s after labor unrest and a fire forced the cigar industry to relocate from Key West. The waterfront city became a major destination for trade between the island and the United States. Until Castro, Tampa ran a passenger ferry to Cuba.

In the past, only U.S. citizens and legal, permanent residents could file applications for their noncitizen spouses and children to become legal residents. Typically, the husband filed the papers for his wife and children.  In domestic violence cases, the husband, already a U.S. citizen or legal resident, often uses his role in the immigration process to keep his wife in the abusive relationship, U.S. officials and representatives of advocacy groups said.  \"Foreign-born spouses and children are particularly vulnerable when their ability to remain in this country is controlled by an abusive U.S. citizen or lawful, permanent resident,\" said INS Commissioner Doris M.

In those situations, the abuser \"often forces family members to stay in abusive relationships by falsely promising their victims that they will petition on their behalf for permanent resident status in the future, or by threatening their victims with deportation -- creating a cycle of continuing abuse,\" she said.  The new rule, which takes effect immediately, will allow abused family members who otherwise would be eligible for permanent residence to seek legal resident status on their own.

Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) introduces an amendment to provide worker protection for U.S. companies affected by illegal immigration.  High court to review English-only laws  The Supreme Court agreed Monday to review whether states can make English their official language and require its use for most government actions.  The justices said they will examine an appeals court ruling that said Arizona's official-English constitutional amendment violates state employees' right of free speech. Twenty-two other states, including Georgia, and at least 40 cities have enacted some type of official- English law, and Congress is considering legislation similar to the amendment Arizona voters adopted in 1988.  The justices may not reach a decision in this case on its merits. Both sides were asked to address whether supporters of the amendment have legal standing to carry the case to the nation's highest court. Only if the court finds that Arizonans for Official English has legal standing will its decision set a precedent for other states.  MUSKIE CRITICAL: Former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie was in critical condition after suffering a heart attack while recovering from surgery at Georgetown University Hospital. He was operated on last week for a blocked artery in his leg. Muskie, 81, a former governor and senator from Maine, was in President Jimmy Carter's Cabinet. He was an early favorite to win the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination, but lost out to George McGovern.

The police chiefs say that since illegal immigrants drive every day anyway, licensing them would lead them to buy auto insurance and learn the rules of the road. The law enforcement officials say one effect would be fewer crashes that involve uninsured motorists, which would help keep insurance premiums down for all drivers. The change in policy would also help police identify people who often lack ID or carry forged documents.  \"However a person came into this country, why would you not want that person to have identification?\" said Chief Eddie Moody of the DeKalb Police Department.  Moody and Atlanta Police Chief Richard Pennington support legislation introduced by Rep. Barbara Mobley (D-Decatur) in the state House of Representatives during the last session. The bill would remove a requirement that limits Georgia driver\\'s licenses to U.S. citizens and legal residents.  Police chiefs in Brunswick, Warner Robins and Glynn County also have endorsed the bill.  The support by police chiefs alarms Phil Kent, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm that supports tighter immigration controls. Kent said it makes no sense for the state to license people whose very presence violates federal law.  \"Not only is it foolish public policy, but it continues to undermine the rule of law,\" he said. \"Police chiefs doing that is incomprehensible.\"  ',\n",

Congress ordered the registrations for males 16 and older carrying  temporary visas from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and Sudan - all  identified by the State Department as countries with links to  terrorism.  The registration system is designed to track all foreign nationals  in the U.S. by 2005. Monday's registration deadline was the first  of four.  But some Denver residents who were required to register said that  the INS did not adequately inform them of the deadline and that the  registration process was long and frustrating.

The difficulties come as men 16 and older report to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service office in Bloomington, where they are interviewed, fingerprinted and photographed.  Some foreign visitors who have gone to register have had removal proceedings started against them if they have past or current problems with their immigration status, attorneys say. Federal officials appear to be unable or unwilling to exercise discretion in those cases, even when the visitors have pending applications for permanent residency, signified by so-called green cards.  The INS has detained people for hours, sometimes in handcuffs, attorneys say, adding that some of the detainees feared being immediately deported.  Outside the Bloomington INS office Friday, a Lebanese native who is studying medicine at the University of Minnesota said he understood the need for heightened security. But he questioned how effective the new tracking system would be.  \"We work hard to come here. We don\\'t want to be treated like terrorists,\" said the student, who didn\\'t want to be identified because he said he feared reprisals. \"We come here to get good training and work hard to contribute to the economy of this country, not to be treated as criminals.\"  \"The goal of finding people who might have devious plans is one thing,\" said immigration attorney Leslie Guyton, whose St. Paul office had three clients, from Syria, Libya and Sudan, detained for a day when they went to register. \"What is going to happen is very innocent people are going to be caught up in this, people who have been law-abiding good people who may be in the process of straightening out their papers.

Samuel G. Kooritzky, 64, was led from the courtroom in handcuffs after the verdict, which followed five hours of deliberation and a week-long trial in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. He faces a probable prison sentence of eight to 10 years on charges of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering and could also forfeit as much as $ 2.5 million that authorities believe was part of the proceeds of his scheme.  Kooritzky owns the Capital Law Centers, with offices in Arlington, Takoma Park and Washington. The firm specialized in applying to state governments for labor certifications, in which a business claims it cannot find a U.S. citizen for a particular job. An immigrant then uses the certification to apply for a permanent resident visa, or \"green card.\"  But Kooritzky\\'s firm submitted thousands of applications for labor certifications without telling the businesses they were being used. Kooritzky filed 230 applications on behalf of two Chili\\'s restaurants in Northern Virginia, 184 applications for one Silver Diner in Arlington, and 173 applications for one Shoney\\'s restaurant in Manassas, ostensibly for cooks and kitchen workers. None of the restaurants had heard of Kooritzky or authorized him to apply for labor certifications on their behalf, their officials testified.  ',\n",

More recently, they have moved here from other parts of the country. Here they found jobs, opportunities and friendships.  Mazlum Kosma, a board member of the Turkish-American Cultural Association of Georgia, or TACAGA, estimates there are 2,500 Turks in the metro area.

The tide of refugees turned into a flood, hastening the collapse not only of East Germany, but of the Iron Curtain, historians say.  Now a growing number of Bush administration officials, policy experts and lawmakers say they are hoping to set off a similar chain reaction inside North Korea. They argue that the stream of refugees from the starved, Stalinist nation into China could sharply increase, particularly if China agreed not to send North Koreans back, and if South Korea and the United States took in more escapees.  \"If this regime were actually to collapse, it won\\'t be through an elite coup,\" said Victor D.

Hoping to break that pattern in the neighborhood with the city\\'s worst violent crime rate, officials of Civil Society, a nonprofit agency in St. Paul, are launching Freedom From Fear, a program aimed at helping people overcome language and other barriers so they will be more likely to report crime.  \"Some of them don\\'t speak English, some don\\'t have the same cultural values, some don\\'t trust the police, some are from cultures that don\\'t encourage going outside your own group to report crime,\" said Linda Miller, executive director of Civil Society, which provides education and advocacy for crime victims from disadvantaged communities. Others fear retaliation or distrust authorities because of problems in their homelands.  The neighborhood had the most auto thefts of any in the city in 2001 and trailed only downtown in the number of calls for service, robberies, aggravated assaults, narcotics and vandalism.  Freedom From Fear is getting started with a four-year, $460,000 grant from a U.S. Justice Department program for crime victims.

The Pew, a Washington-based arm of the University of Southern California, tabulated Census Bureau survey data of adults ages 25 and older from 1970 to 2000 to make its findings.  The study struck an optimistic note, emphasizing that the educational profiles of the Hispanic foreign-born are improving faster than those of native-born Americans of all ethnicities, although gaps remain, especially on college degrees.  B. Lindsay Lowell, Pew\\'s research director and the study\\'s primary author, said the data should counter claims made by some advocates of more immigration restrictions that the education level of the Hispanic immigrant population is falling behind that of the U.S.-born.  \"In the coming decades, the educational composition of the Latino foreign-born population will begin to look more like that of the American native-born population,\" the report says.  The report concedes that much of the potential for \"gap closing\" reflects the stagnant growth in education levels among native-born Americans, about 90 percent of whom complete high school. With such high percentages, there is little room for improvement.  At the same time, Hispanic immigrants have seen the rate of high school completion double over the last 30 years, to 40 percent.

''In the coming decades, the educational composition of the Latino foreign-born population will begin to look more like that of the American native-born population,'' authors B. Lindsay Lowell and Roberto Suro wrote in the report, which covered people 25 and older.  The analysis of Census Bureau data between 1970 and 2000 found the share of Hispanic immigrants who had graduated from high school increased from 28 percent to 59 percent, while for all Americans it increased from 55 percent to 84 percent.  That gap is likely to narrow, the report said, as younger foreign-born residents who tend to have more education displace in the population older residents who are less educated. In addition, more immigrant families are getting their education in the United States, where schools tend to be better than in Latin American countries.  Data from the 2000 census showed the Hispanic population more than doubled during the 1990s to 35.3 million, rivaling blacks as the nation's largest minority group. Many Latinos from Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Central America, arrived in the past decade to take plentiful, low-skilled, low-paying jobs in factories, meatpacking plants and on farms.  \",\n",

The 19th annual meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission, headed by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda. ended Tuesday afternoon with many promises but little action on matters that have caused tension between the neighboring countries.  The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington changed the priorities of the Bush administration, and progress on reaching a new immigration accord with Mexico will take time, Powell and Castaneda told reporters at the end of the summit.  ''The Bush administration sees Mexico as more than a neighbor. . . . Mexico is also a partner who helps the United States combat terrorism and helps ensure Iraq complies with the U.N. resolution to disarm weapons of mass destruction,'' Powell said.  Powell said there was no ''specific deal'' on immigration or on Mexico's growing water debt to drought-stricken U.S. farmers. But Powell said ties with Mexico were at an all-time high despite policy changes caused by Sept. 11.  Castaneda, who has repeatedly stated that the United States would eventually have to accept a more lenient migration accord given the reality of millions of Mexicans already in the United States, took a less positive tone than Powell. ''There is no plan, no time frame to legalize Mexicans, nor is it foreseen. It is being negotiated, as it has been all along,'' said Castaneda, one of President Vicente Fox's closest advisers.  \",\n",

Only 9 percent of 302 U.S. immigrants interviewed for the study use banks to send money home, according to the study by the Pew Hispanic Center and the Inter-American Development Bank. Eighty-three percent still use wire transfer companies, and the remaining 8 percent send money home by courier or family member, according to the study released Friday.  Although costs for transfers have dropped, many immigrants still pay fees totaling 10 percent to 15 percent of the amounts that they send back to their families, an average of $200 to $300 at a time, the report said.  \"If you look at what it costs you now to either go overseas and pay a bill with a credit card from an American bank or make a withdrawal from an ATM, the costs are a fraction of what [immigrants] pay\" to repatriate money, said Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center.  The center and the Multilateral Investment Fund of the development bank conducted the research to gauge how immigrants are responding to the changing money-transfer industry and to spur financial institutions to enter the market.  The immigrants said they don\\'t use American banks because they require them to have U.S. documents and because fees and minimum balances are expensive. Some fear opening an account could lead to being deported or detained.  ',\n",

Since then, she has learned a painful lesson.  As an ethnic German in Kazakstan, she said, she faced nationalist hostility among Kazaks who called her a foreigner. Now she confronts another kind of animosity from Germans who do not accept her as a German and who say she and others like her receive social benefits they do not deserve.  \"In Kazakstan they said we were Germans and should go back to Germany,\" said Mrs. Schleicher, 32, who was a librarian in Almaty, Kazakstan, and collects admission at a public swimming pool in this small town in western Germany. \"Now we are in Germany and people here curse us as \\'the Russians.\\' \"  She is not alone. Since the late 1980\\'s, in one of Europe\\'s greatest population shifts since the end of the cold war, more than a million ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union have taken advantage of German laws permitting them to reclaim full citizenship, and thus automatic access to Germany\\'s bountiful welfare system that provides unemployment pay, housing allowances and state pensions.  But their arrival has coincided with economic straits for many Germans, who are facing record unemployment at a time when the abundance of social benefits is being called into question. A result has been a greater readiness among Germans to attribute their woes to their immigrant kin, and an equal readiness among politicians to play to those passions for votes.  ',\n",

The House on March 20 voted, 257-163, to give states the power to deny public education to illegal immigrant children.  The vote came as the House was debating a sweeping overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.  At issue is a 1982 Supreme Court decision that said that states did not have the authority to deny illegal alien children access to public education.  Federal courts have blocked implementation of California's Proposition 187, which would have cut off education for illegal immigrant children, by citing the Supreme Court decision.  The Republican-sponsored amendment to the immigration bill would leave the question entirely up to the states to decide, but it would not apply to children born in the United States, even if their parents were illegal aliens.  Proponents of the amendment argued that children who come into the United States illegally were unfairly taking resources away from citizens.  'Whose children do we care about?' asked Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. 'We care about our children first, and we make no apology for it.'  Texas Democrat John Bryant led the fight against the amendment.  'The Supreme Court ruled a long time ago that we will not visit the sins of the mothers and fathers on children when it comes to education,' he said.  \",\n",

At the INS office at 4360 Northlake Blvd., up to 250 people a day waited in line each morning at 6 a.m. to change the cards. Appointment numbers went to the first 200 who arrived, and the remainder were told to return another day.  Frank Ricci, a private immigration attorney, said earlier in the week that a posted INS notice showing a ticking clock and Monday's date was scaring people.  ''I talked to a woman who was crying hysterically and said she's been in the country for 34 years and doesn't want to be deported,'' Ricci said.  The green card renewal and long lines were upsetting to many of the longtime U.S. residents who are required by law to exchange their cards.  The INS announced last year that all noncitizens granted residency status in the United States before 1979 had until March 20 to replace their green cards. The application requires photographs, fingerprints and a $ 75 fee.  \",\n",

Bradley, 57, was arrested Oct. 16 on felony trespassing charges after feeding cats at a private construction site. Bradley promised not to violate any laws unless a higher court gives her permission, said David Roth, her Palm Beach attorney, on Friday. Her court appearance was to establish whether her latest arrest violates the conditions stemming from more than a dozen misdemeanor arrests and about 40 citations on similar charges. Bradley will have to check in with court authorities twice a month. Bradley used to lead the Palm Beach Cat Rescue & Humane Society before city attorneys began enforcing a town law prohibiting feral-cat colonies this year.  WEST PALM BEACH - Two men pleaded guilty in federal court on Friday to attempting to smuggle illegal immigrants into Florida on separate boats. Yvan Charles, 46, of Haiti admitted to piloting a sailboat with 36 illegal Dominican immigrants aboard. Charles was arrested Aug. 20 off the Boca Raton coast when he and two of the immigrants went to buy food for the passengers. In a separate incident, Steveson Saunders, 48, of the Bahamas tried to smuggle in five illegal immigrants from Jamaica, Guyana, Haiti and Cuba. He was arrested after a fisherman spotted his small boat drifting off of the Lake Worth coast Aug. 22 and alerted the Coast Guard. Both men face 10-year prison sentences.  ',\n",

He met his 17-year-old traveling companion, John Lee Malvo, an illegal immigrant from Jamaica, when he dated the teenager's mother in Washington State. The teenager called Mr. Muhammad his father and followed a strict diet of crackers, honey and vitamin supplements that the older man prescribed, relatives said.  The two lived almost as destitutes early this year in a Lighthouse Mission in Bellingham, Wash., a small city in the far northwest corner of the country. They traveled this summer and early fall through Louisiana, New Jersey and finally to the nation's capital. They were arrested together early this morning at a Maryland rest stop while sleeping in a former undercover police car with nearly 150,000 miles on it.  After being arraigned in federal court in Baltimore this afternoon, they are being held in connection with the 13 sniper attacks that terrorized suburban Washington for the past three weeks. Federal officials said they were confident that the homicidal rampage, which killed 10 people, had come to an end.  But what precipitated the killings, what guided the seemingly random selection of innocents, and even what drew to Mr. Muhammad, 41, and the boy to the Washington area is far from clear. Some federal officials speculated that Mr. Muhammad, who converted to Islam in 1985 and later changed his last name from Williams, had been motivated by anti-American sentiments.  \",\n",

His friend Luis Flores, who was voted most likely to succeed and  wants to go to Stanford, was there, too, along with Laura Torres,  nominated for the same honor.

These smart sons and daughters of factory workers, day laborers and  cleaning ladies are the kinds of students sought by elite colleges  and universities eager for ethnic and economic diversity. But these  students can't afford to go even to state-funded schools, not  because of their status as illegal immigrants, but because of the  costs.  Although legislative initiatives in states like California, Texas  and New York have been heralded as compassionate moves to make  higher education accessible to otherwise qualified illegal  immigrants, a review suggests little large-scale effect on the  problem.  While such measures theoretically narrow the costs of higher  education by allowing students who entered the country illegally to  still qualify for in-state tuition, the reality is that many  undocumented families are still unable to afford college tuition.  \",\n",

The ongoing \"voluntary interviews\" are part of a broad domestic security campaign, nicknamed Operation Liberty Shield, meant to guard against possible retribution for the U.S.-led war, officials have said.

Officials would not say where the detentions occurred or why, or whether the people were foreign nationals.  The FBI says interviewees are free to refuse to answer questions. This does not apply to the separate search by the Homeland Security Department.

Giving state and local cops authority to detain illegal aliens and hand them over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Increasing penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud.

But civil liberties groups and immigration-law specialists said the wording of the administration\\'s announcement was so broad that it could ultimately require the imprisonment of thousands of asylum seekers, including Iraqis persecuted and even tortured by the government of Saddam Hussein.  \"This sends a message to people who are the victims of human rights abuses that we are going to put you into detention if you come from the very countries that the U.S. has identified -- that President Bush has identified -- as having torture chambers and committing egregious human rights abuses,\" said Bill Frelick, director of the refugee program for Amnesty International USA.

Their linguistic labor, performed innumerable times, in surprising situations, in dozens of languages, is a double-edged rite of passage that can save lives but cheat childhoods.

Teitelbaum (Op-Ed, March 19) contributes to the witch-hunt call to curtail the limited legal immigration of skilled foreign workers who fill technical positions.  To be eligible for employment in the United States, a skilled foreign worker and the prospective employer-sponsor must submit applications and support documents to the Department of Labor and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which have safeguards that must be met before a foreign worker may secure nonimmigrant status.  An employer must pay the foreign worker a designated \"prevailing wage\" for the position as determined by the Labor Department. That wage is generally higher than the free-market rate for the position.  In addition, the sponsor company must prove that there are no qualified United States candidates for the job, advertise it in a widely circulated newspaper and post it internally so that employees may also apply. If a United States candidate meets the minimum requirements, he or she is considered acceptable by the Labor Department and the application for the foreign worker is rejected, precluding the company from proceeding to filing an application with the I.N.S.

Then word reached the people of Arroyo Hondo that the 17-year-old wasn\\'t coming home after all. Her parents had chosen to bury her in Louisburg, N.C., fearing that if they brought her body across the border into Mexico they would be barred from going back.  Jesica Santillan left Arroyo Hondo four years ago when her parents paid a smuggler to sneak her into the United States for better medical care. Last month she got a heart-lung transplant, but a mistake in the blood type caused her death.  Now, the complexities of immigration law have disrupted her village\\'s plans for a dignified farewell and have compounded resentments among its 300 people.

Known as Bukharan Jews, after an Uzbek city, and proud of traditions seen nowhere else in Judaism, they have grown to almost 40,000 strong, establishing synagogues and flavorful restaurants. But in recent years they have been grappling with a demon that seems to have slipped in with the baggage they brought over.  Back there, Bukharan Jews lived among patriarchal societies where the husband ruled the household and sometimes enforced his will with a raised hand. But here, Bukharan men, like those of many other immigrant groups, are confronting the realities of a new land.  Their wives, less finicky about working as home health aides and supermarket cashiers, are often the first to land jobs and, even after their husbands do, sometimes end up earning more money. At work, they see accomplished and outspoken women, and steadily and subtly their relationships with their husbands shift. Some men, already frustrated by their clumsiness with a strange language and perplexing streets, chafe at their diminished status. A few -- not many, but enough to worry the Bukharan community -- take their anger out on their wives.  ',\n",
       " \"IMM-13375  PRIMARY  WASHINGTON IN BRIEF  The Justice Department has dropped plans to tighten security by shortening the visits of vacationing foreigners, soothing a policy rift between President Bush and his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.  Last Friday, hours before the Department of Homeland Security was to take over immigration enforcement, the Justice Department dropped the plan and dozens more proposed regulations that could not have been set up by the time of the Saturday switchover, officials said.  It was unclear whether the proposal had been killed or temporarily set aside, Justice and Homeland Security officials said.  This week, the Florida governor issued a statement hailing the decision. Tightening tourist visa rules, Gov. Bush said, would have hobbled his state's top industry. Tourism generates 20 percent of Florida's revenue and employs 870,000 people, he said.  The Bush administration in April proposed eliminating the automatic six-month stay currently granted to international tourists when they arrive in the United States. Instead, it wanted inspectors to grant tourists only as much time as needed to complete their trips, up to six months.  Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, immigration officials had sought ways to better track foreign visitors, and supporters of the proposal noted that tourist visas remain among the most abused immigration documents.  Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers had entered the U.S. legally on travel visas.  Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the United States is opposed to North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons and has not resigned itself to trying to contain the expansion of nuclear efforts by the communist regime.  \",\n",

We asked Rummery to answer questions about the transition.  Q What happens to pending applications for citizenship, green cards and other requests?  A The same thing happens to it this week as if you'd filed it last week. Samepeople, same location, same fingerprinting sites, using the same forms. The whole change is going to be transparent to people we serve.  Q Are there going to be new offices for the BCIS?  A We're not moving. We're going to put up the banners with the new name, BCIS, soon, at the same locations in San Francisco and San Jose.  Q Will there be delays in processing applications as a result of the transition?  A This is a change that isn't change.

But the cyclist, Reza K. Baluchi, 30, remains in custody in Florence, Ariz., while the Immigration and Naturalization Service decides whether to appeal the decision of the judge, LaMonte Freerks, to allow Mr. Baluchi to remain in the United States.  \"I have been four months in jail,\" Mr. Baluchi said in a telephone interview from the immigration service\\'s detention center. \"Two days more no problem.\"  It is uncertain whether Mr. Baluchi will be released that quickly. The federal immigration lawyer who prosecuted him, Virginia Vasquez, said she had 30 days to file a notice of appeal. \"It\\'s under advisement,\" she said.  Ms. Vasquez argued that Mr. Baluchi had not been persecuted for his political beliefs in Iran, but rather had simply been prosecuted for breaking the law there. The Iranian government, she said, has a right to impose whatever laws it sees fit, and the United States has no obligation to protect someone who violates them.  Mr. Baluchi said that after his arrest on Nov. 10 he received hundreds of letters of support from around the country, as well as dozens of e-mail messages sent to a Web site set up on his behalf by a fellow cyclist. What seemed to have appealed to his supporters was the account of his odyssey, which he said took him from a life of persecution in Iran for associating with \"counterrevolutionaries\" to a life on the road, visiting places like China, South Africa, France, New Zealand and Panama -- 54 countries in all. Everywhere he went, Mr. Baluchi said, he spread his message of love and peace.  ',\n",

Colorado would be the first state to cut health benefits based on  citizenship if the proposal wins final approval.  Under a Republican-backed measure that passed a House committee, an  estimated 3,500 immigrants like Hasanovic would no longer be able  to count on the government-funded health care traditionally  available to Coloradans living in poverty.  The move is part of feverish budget cutting driven by declining tax  revenues, a constitutional requirement to balance the budget, and  voter-passed limits on taxes and spending.

The move reflects the growing frustration at home and abroad with a new Justice Department initiative to photograph and fingerprint male citizens of 25 countries, including Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The registration program, which requires males from these countries without permanent immigration status and older than 16 to register with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is part of an effort to better screen foreign visitors to determine if they are linked to terrorist activities.  Kasuri said he would raise the issue along with other matters when he meets Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and members of Congress next week. Kasuri and his advisers said Pakistan would also ask Washington to resume arms sales to Pakistan, lift a travel advisory warning U.S. citizens not to visit Pakistan and increase market access in the United States for Pakistani textiles.  Kasuri said the registration program has fueled a major political crisis back home, where it has been used to criticize the government's support for the U.S.-led war on terrorism.

Florida spends more than $ 400-million a year for illegal immigrant children in its schools, with no help from the federal government.  But Gov. Lawton Chiles has said he opposes measures like the one the House passed. He says he would rather have the children in school than on the streets.  In a series of votes, the House took steps to nationalize California\\'s Proposition 187, which was passed overwhelmingly in 1994 to deny nearly all benefits to illegal immigrants. It has been tied up in California courts every since.  The House said illegal immigrant parents should not be allowed to apply for welfare on behalf of their children who were born in this country and are U.S. citizens. Lawmakers said it\\'s a back door way to collect welfare, which  already is banned for illegal immigrants.  ',\n",

With limited options in a country that she described as not very sympathetic to those who are different, Kayumova found it nearly impossible to get the care her daughter needed.  \"They don\\'t understand, and no one could help her in Uzbekistan,\" said Kayumova from her apartment in Richmond Hill. \"She couldn\\'t go to school there because they don\\'t have special schools.\"  Kayumova was not the only parent who felt alone in her quest to help a disabled child. Another woman from Queens who moved to the United States from the Ukraine a decade ago and who asked not to be identified, has a 16-year-old son who is severely autistic.  \"In the Ukraine, they expect everyone to be the same. Having a disability is considered very, very abnormal,\" she said. \"If we were still living there, we would get no support, and I am not sure if my son would still be living with us.\"  Today, both women are being helped by the Maidstone Foundation, a Manhattan-based nonprofit organization that assists other nonprofits that help people who have difficulty receiving services because of cultural or language barriers, or because of rare or multiple disabilities.  Since 1987, Maidstone has been working with immigrants from the former Soviet Union who have family members with developmental disabilities, offering them outreach, information, referral and translation. It also exposes them to cultural events.  ',\n",

But it is continually surprising to find out just how misunderstood.  A fascinating survey released last week debunks many of the tired stereotypes too many Americans have about newcomers. It also provides some first-person insight into what the lives of foreign-born residents have been like since 9/11.  The findings deserve particular attention because they come from a reliable source and are the result of credible methodology - qualities that are hard to find in studies of immigrants. The Public Agenda Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group sponsored by the Carnegie Corp. of New York, questioned 1,002 foreign-born adults who came to live in the United States when they were at least 5 years old. Each interview averaged 28 minutes. Interviewers spoke English and Spanish, did not question legal status and assured respondents their comments were confidential. Researchers tried hard to get straight answers.  Before beginning the survey, Public Agenda consulted with a cross section of advocacy groups and experts on both sides of the issue - proponents of tighter immigration policy and supporters of a more open policy. The approach was even-handed.  Consider some of the myths and false assumptions that fell by the wayside:  Immigrants do not want to learn English.  Wrong. Nearly two out of three (65 percent) said the United States should expect all immigrants who don't speak English to learn it. Eighty-seven percent said speaking English was extremely important, and 63 percent said all public school classes should be taught in English rather than native languages. Immigrants believe they need the language to work; 85 percent said it's hard to get a good job without being fluent.  \",\n",

At 14, the undocumented immigrant -- in the United States for 10 years with his farmworker family -- was snatched from his California classroom by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and deported to Mexico.  So begins ''Breaking Through,'' a memoir by Jimenez, which thousands of Santa Clara Valley residents of all ages are reading as part of the project Silicon Valley Reads: One Book, One Community, which began this month.  ''How we break through the obstacles in our lives is something we can share to develop a stronger sense of community,'' said Jimenez, now 59 and professor of modern languages and literatures and director of ethnic studies at Santa Clara University.

The authorities knew a little more about him. He had first come to their attention in 1998, when he applied for asylum on the grounds that he faced persecution at home for his religious views and political affiliations. As is common in Britain's understaffed and overwhelmed immigration system, his case was not heard right away: it took three years for his application to be rejected. He filed an appeal to the decision, but then slipped out of sight.  But in the last two weeks, since traces of the deadly toxin ricin were found in a nondescript apartment in a north London neighborhood, antiterrorism investigators have been focusing on the shadowy networks of Algerians believed to be potential terrorists in Britain. Their investigation -- and the arrest of seven suspects of North African origin in connection with the ricin discovery in London -- led them to the 23-year-old Algerian's apartment in Manchester, and to the operation that resulted in the stabbing death on Tuesday of Detective Constable Stephen Oake.  The 23-year-old, whose name has not been released by the authorities, is just one of 17 people, all described as North Africans, to be arrested or detained in the last two weeks.

The commission filed complaints in federal courts in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Washington, D.C. Officials said the operations used unsolicited e-mail messages and Web sites to promote the permits.  An international driving permit translates a government-issued driver's license into different languages; it is not a substitute for an American license, or any other identification document issued in the United States. J. Howard Beales, director of consumer protection at the commission, said the fraudulent permits misled people with limited English proficiency.

The votes reflected wide concern in states such as California over the burden to state and federal governments of providing benefits to \"illegals.\"  The House also supported establishment of a program under which employers will be able to verify with a governmment data base whether job -seekers can legally work in the United States.  The pilot program had aroused widespread opposition among both conservatives and civil libertarians as the start of a \"big brother\" national identity system.  In heated debate, members argued that children should not be made to suffer for the fact that their parents entered the country illegally.  But in a rare address to the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich argued forcefully for an amendment by Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., to allow states to deny children of illegal aliens the right to attend public schools.  Gingrich said that requiring states to provide their schooling was a federal \"unfunded mandate\" - an order from Washington that the federal government does not pay for.  Citing California\\'s Proposition 187 clamping down on benefits for illegal aliens, Gingrich said: \"I think it\\'s wrong for us to be the welfare capital of the world.  \"Come to America for opportunity.

       " 'IMM-13631  PRIMARY  Forgotten Detainees  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT started off the year with what it portrayed as a relatively clean slate in its terrorism investigation: Spokesmen announced last month that only six of the people detained in the Sept. 11 dragnet remain in U.S. custody. But that number is wildly misleading and takes advantage of a very narrow and technical definition of who counts as a detainee. In truth there are hundreds and perhaps thousands of immigrants, mostly Arabs and other Muslims, who would not be in detention but for Sept. 11, and who are now wending their way through a capricious and choked-up immigration system. Because they are not classified as \"special interest\" immigration cases, they receive no particular attention and aren\\'t counted in the government\\'s terrorism figures.  One such forgotten detainee is Ansar Mahmood, a Pakistani immigrant we wrote about on this page nearly 10 months ago. Mr. Mahmood is not counted in the Justice Department numbers, though by any reasonable definition he is a Sept. 11 detainee. He was picked up on suspicion of tainting the New York water supply and then almost immediately cleared by the FBI, which ultimately believed his story -- that he had only been photographing the scenic mountains near Rochester. He had a green card and a good job. But because police inquiries uncovered that he had helped some illegal Pakistani friends find jobs, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) put him in jail pending deportation, where he has been all this time.

And \"Now That I\\'m Here: What America\\'s Immigrants Have to Say About Life in the U.S. Today,\" a survey released Tuesday by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Public Agenda, a New York research organization, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, makes a contribution to that debate.  \"There is a much sharper focus on immigration since Sept. 11, and we believe that it is essential, as part of this debate, to hear from immigrants themselves and to do it in a reliable way,\" said Deborah Wadsworth, president of Public Agenda.  \"If you look at the values and attitudes of the immigrants polled, they are as American as Americans get,\" said Steve Farkas, Public Agenda\\'s senior vice president and director of research. \"They believe in American values, such as hard work and making their own way.\"  They also believe in education, honesty and giving back to the community.  Come to think of it, immigrants who share American values should not be surprising. After all, that is why they come to the U.S. in the first place.  Just ask Betty and Orlando Arias, a couple in their 30s, who live in Rego Park with their 4-year-old daughter Denisha.

The prospect petrifies some who work and pay taxes but have overstayed a visa, said Rehan Khan, a Henry County businessman and former president of the Pakistani American Society of Atlanta. He said they worry \"they will go to jail and be deported\" and wonder why the government singles out visitors from countries whose governments have allied themselves with the United States in the war on terrorism.  \"They are not pointing to Mexicans or Chinese,\" he said. \"Why are they pointing to Pakistanis?\"  In Georgia and around the United States, the INS has significantly stepped up the detention and deportation of foreign nationals from Muslim nations in response to public pressure to safeguard the United States from terrorists like the ones who struck Sept. 11, 2001. The number of people deported to Muslim countries in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia multiplied faster than for citizens of virtually every other country, according to a Journal-Constitution computer analysis of INS records.  The new focus disrupted the routine of Carma Said of Bethlehem, Pa. She said the INS deported her husband to Egypt even though it had approved his request for legal residency.  ',\n",

A Bangladeshi accountant who was weary of his country's politics. A Jamaican woman who has been in this country for 18 years, made a life for herself and decided that it was time. And a Filipino mechanical engineer who has dreamed of being here since he was a teenager.  They were among 200 people who came to Manhattan Federal Court one day this month to take an oath of allegiance as new Americans.  Naturalization ceremonies are a weekly occurrence in federal courtrooms in Brooklyn and Manhattan, where immigrant dreams are realized and American determinations are made.  Their stories are filled with longings for a better life, only to be met with hardships of working at fast-food restaurants, supporting relatives on different shores and going to school.  Some immigrants take the step for patriotic reasons, and others are doing it because they fear that their rights are eroding around them. All have kept tight bonds with their homelands.  Mark Thorn, a New York spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said 94,746 people were naturalized in fiscal 2002, down from 97,953 the previous year.  The terrorist attacks in 2001 created an unprecedented surge of U.S. citizenship applications, forming an even greater backlog for immigration officials, who now must perform tighter security checks.

The expiration of the cards, effective yesterday, does not change the legal status of the card holders. No one will lose permanent resident status -- which allows legal residents to live and work in the United States indefinitely -- if they have not yet applied for the new, more secure card, agency officials said. Nor will holders of old cards be penalized.  But agency officials said that holders of old cards must replace them with new cards to maintain acceptable evidence of their immigration status and to avoid inconvenience in getting jobs, entitlement benefits and reentry into the United States.  Someone with an expired green card who tries to enter the United States starting today may be taken aside at the airport by U.S. officials and given instructions about applying for a replacement card, officials said.  Residents with old cards should apply as soon as possible for a replacement at their local INS offices, officials said.  Agency officials said they did not know how many legal, permanent residents in the Washington area need to apply for new cards. But the INS Arlington office, which serves Northern Virginia and District residents, and the INS Baltimore office, which covers Maryland, have reported increases in applications for green cards since the agency started publicizing the card replacement program three years ago.

It hasn't happened, and as a result Mexico's enlightened foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda, has resigned.  The centerpiece of the new relationship was to have been a new accord on immigration. That encountered early resistance on Capitol Hill, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rearranged the White House's priorities. Washington has since failed to recognize that an immigration deal that serves American economic needs and diminishes the population living illegally in this country can be compatible with heightened security.  The White House's neglect has proved to be politically damaging to Mr. Fox's administration. The Mexican government had to overcome widespread public skepticism, and concerns about surrendering national sovereignty, to sell the idea of a new understanding with the neighboring superpower. Mr. Castaneda was the most outspoken advocate of closer ties with the United States. His frustration over the stalemate in the relationship contributed to his decision to resign.  Mr. Castaneda worked tirelessly to promote an immigration deal and closer cooperation in fighting drug trafficking and on other law enforcement matters. He ended Mexico's tradition of warm ties with Cuba in order to back American denunciations of Fidel Castro's human rights record.  \",\n",

The speaker made the remarks at a news conference noting the first meeting of his special task force on immigration. Eight of the 41 task force members are Democrats, including Rep.

Deal said he won the appointment because there is a \"tremendous problem\" with illegal Hispanic immigrants in the Gainesville and Dalton areas, including some gang activity.

The piece concludes that \"by the time Congress finishes its work this year, America will be a \\'different country\\' and the \\'60s a fading force.\"  SPLIT DECISION: Give Gingrich a split decision on one of his more celebrated quests - cutting back public broadcasting. The House easily turned back an attempt by conservative Republicans to end all federal funding for public broadcasting over three years, but that was just part of the picture. The proposal by Rep.

He had heard the cells were cold, so Harizi wore thermal underwear and a turtle neck sweater. He had heard metal objects were prohibited in jail, so he didn't wear a belt or a watch. Instead, he brought two friends, who had instructions to pay bills, call his family in Tunisia and coordinate with a lawyer.  But he wasn't detained. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) asked him to return in a week with more paperwork.  Although Harizi fears deportation, the former Sonoma State University student hopes for some way to remain in the United States legally.  ''I don't know what will happen later,'' Harizi said.  The effort to closely track immigrant men and boys from mostly Middle Eastern and Muslim countries is having seismic effects on the immigration system, heavily criticized after Sept. 11, 2001, for lax enforcement of the law.

This doesn't mean keeping out legal immigrants, but it does require hermetically sealing the borders to illegals to prevent more terrorists from following the Christmas lead of the five Pakistani men who slipped across the Canadian border.  Since we can't achieve true border security overnight, government officials should start by fixing the things that are most broken. All 19 of the Sept. 11 terrorists came here on legal visas -- 15 of which were issued in one country, Saudi Arabia -- so the attention that has been paid to visas was warranted and is still necessary. The program formerly known as Visa Express -- where all Saudi residents were expected to submit visa applications to private Saudi travel agents -- was thankfully scrapped, but much work on the visa front remains.  Applicants in Saudi Arabia, for example, still get approved for visas at far higher rates than those from neighboring nations, even though we know the House of Saud has allowed us to reap the Islamic radicalism that it sows.

International cargo planes, passenger flights and ships --- including those coming from Mexico and Canada --- are included in the proposed monitoring system.

Under the rule proposed by the INS, the airlines and ships would have to provide in advance information on citizenship, birth date, residence, passport number and \"such other information\" that federal officials decide is necessary for enforcing immigration laws and protecting national security. The rule would take effect after a 30-day comment period.  The INS has been criticized for its bureaucracy and lengthy backlogs in processing applications and gathering information.  Since 1989, most airlines have been providing advance lists of some noncitizen passengers under a voluntary agreement with the federal government. The new rule would expand the practice to all passengers and make it mandatory.  The lists must be transmitted electronically, so that names can be more easily matched against computer databases for possible criminal or terrorist ties.  The INS estimates that the rule will affect 108 large commercial air carriers and ship lines and more than 14,400 smaller carriers.

Calling female genital mutilation a form of \"torture,\" the U.S. Appeals Court for the 7th Circuit last Friday granted Philomena Nwaokolo\\'s request for a review of her case to ensure that her toddler daughter is \"not forced into exile to be tortured.\"  Genital mutilation, an extremely painful procedure that carries the risk of infection, hemorrhage and sometimes death, is widely practiced in parts of Nigeria and other African countries.  By equating it with torture, which is prohibited under international convention, the court presented federal immigration authorities with what could be a formidable obstacle in deporting African women.  \"It\\'s really a barbaric practice and has now been recognized as such by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals,\" said Morton Sklar, Nwaokolo\\'s attorney and director of the World Organization Against Torture USA, based in Washington.  Officials for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Dallas would not talk about the case publicly, referring calls to the Justice Department in Washington. The Justice Department did not return phone calls seeking comment.  Nwaokolo, 42, a registered nurse at the Children\\'s Medical Center of Dallas, entered the United States legally 20 years ago. But she fell afoul of immigration laws two years later by taking a paid job as a nurse\\'s aide, in violation of her visa restrictions.  ',\n",

The Mexican immigrant sat in court Wednesday with other prisoners, with no case file, no docket entry, just an anonymous immigrant in a blue jumpsuit. Hernandez left staff and attorneys in the courtroom briefly wondering what he was doing there.  \"What am I accused of?\" the 37-year-old repeatedly asked his interpreter.  Nada.  Three seats away in the prisoner box was the reason why he was there - his countryman, Euxodio Pedro Jose. Jose, 32, ran a red light, causing an accident that killed a woman in another car last November. Hernandez was his passenger and was never charged in the case. But he\\'s been handcuffed to it ever since, first taken into custody for being an illegal immigrant, then jailed locally when prosecutors wanted him handy to be a witness in the case.  A defense attorney appointed Wednesday - the first one Hernandez has had since his jailing - was appalled that a witness was being held with no attorney just because he\\'s an illegal immigrant. Immigrants are treated disparately, and Mexican migrants probably among the worst, said Nellie King after court. \"This would not happen to a French au pair working illegally in Palm Beach,\" King said.

Is there any way to extend the H-1B?  Michael Friedman San Jose A There is no \"grace period\" that allows your fiancee to remain lawfully in the United States. The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services would consider her to be \"out of status\" since February, when she was laid off from her H-1B employer, according to Kelly McCown, an immigration lawyer with Tafapolsky Smith Evans & McCown in San Francisco.  And, since H-1B status is employer-specific, she will need a new employer sponsor to lawfully work in the United States or to extend her status beyond Oct. 1, McCown said. Should she find a job by then, the best strategy is for the new employer to file a new H-1B petition and request premium processing, which generally will be resolved within 15 calendar days, McCown said.  This strategy is safer than filing a request to extend her H-1B status with the new employer, McCown said.  Also, if she has not worked without authorization since her last U.S. entry, she may be able to take advantage of a provision called \"H-1B portability\" while awaiting approval of the H-1B petition filed by the new company, McCown said.

Tom Tancredo raised  concerns the event would attract undocumented immigrants.  The planned July 12 workshop was aimed at people who are not  eligible for Social Security numbers, but must file federal tax  returns with the Internal Revenue Service.  The event would have helped people apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.  The number allows parents to claim nonresident children or allows  nonresidents with U.S. investments to file taxes, said Jerry  Eckery, an IRS tax specialist.  But a loophole allows undocumented immigrants living in the country  illegally to apply for the number. They also can use the number to  open bank accounts and, in some states, get a driver's license.  'I am concerned that the way the workshop is being advertised is  likely to attract illegal aliens as participants,' Tancredo wrote  to the treasurers June 10. 'I hope that your office will take  steps to avoid being complicit in breaking the law.'  Jean Carl, an IRS spokeswoman, said it is 'most likely  undocumented immigrants who use' the number.  The IRS asked Adams County Treasurer John Lefebvre to help  low-income people file their taxes, and Lefebvre approached  Jefferson County Treasurer Mark Paschall to do the same.  After receiving Tancredo's letter, both decided Wednesday not to  participate in the program. The workshop was never advertised.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-1378  PRIMARY  AMERICANS WANT A CHANGE - CUT, REFORM LEGAL IMMIGRATION  ACCORDING to a February Roper Poll, 83 percent of Americans believe that immigration levels are excessive and that the process of selecting immigrants pays little heed to our national needs. While much attention has been paid to illegal immigration, it is clear that Americans want legal immigration overhauled too. Today, the House of Representatives begins debate on legislation that would take an important first step toward meaningful reform. A similar bill is on its way to the Senate floor. These bills would reduce immigration by about 25 percent, to a still overly generous level of about 575,000 annually (approximately the levels that existed before 1990).  Second, the legislation would end family chain migration. Our current law is an open-ended entitlement program that promises immigrants not only the right to bring a spouse and minor children, but a whole range of extended relatives who, in turn, apply for their extended families. Aside from creating a never-ending chain (some 3.7 million such relatives have already applied), the system does not select immigrants based on personal qualifications. Consequently, immigrants are now 50 percent more likely to be dependent on public assistance than the rest of the population.  Some have suggested that the bills be split and that legal and illegal immigration be addressed separately. This is an overt effort to kill legal immigration reform and will only heighten the public's discontent. Our entire immigration policy is dysfunctional, and the sooner it is reformed the better it will be for all concerned.  \",\n",

However, she added, \"this is a new and fairly demanding immigrant population, in the sense that many are coming from war-torn countries and have a lot of unmet needs.\"  Washington, like the rest of the region, experienced a surge in immigration in the 1990s.

The program last year had a major, if unintended, impact: It exposed many unauthorized immigrants who were working \"on the books,\" using stolen or made-up Social Security numbers. Confronted by their employers, tens of thousands of them quietly left their jobs or were fired, according to estimates by immigration advocates and attorneys.  The Social Security Administration had launched the initiative, sending letters last year to about 950,000 employers who had at least one worker whose name and number did not match Social Security files. Government officials said at the time that they were simply trying to get employers and workers to correct the agency\\'s records.  But few responded, said Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration. As a result, he said, the agency plans to contact only about 130,000 employers this year in an effort to be \"using our resources effectively -- time, money, staff, that kind of thing.\"  Immigrant advocates and members of business groups, who had protested the earlier Social Security program, said they were pleased with the change.

The reforms, prompted by a blistering report from the Justice Department\\'s inspector general, are a welcome improvement.  But they will need the support of Attorney General John Ashcroft, who has shown little remorse about his department\\'s mishandling of immigrants.  The inspector general\\'s report found \"significant problems\" in the post-Sept. 11 roundup of suspected terrorists. Many detainees were classified as terrorism suspects on scant evidence. There was a \"pattern of physical and verbal abuse.\" And detainees were denied access to lawyers. Responding to the report, the Justice Department said it made \"no apologies\" for how it went about protecting the American public. While asking Congress for new terrorism-fighting powers, Mr. Ashcroft used similar language.  By adopting the new policies, the government is at least implicitly admitting that mistakes were made. The new guidelines, based on 12 recommendations in the inspector general\\'s report, include clearer standards for deciding when a detained immigrant should be considered a terrorism suspect, and improvements in conditions of confinement.  If these reforms are going to work, they cannot be mere words in a rule book. Mr. Ashcroft should embrace them publicly, and explain to law enforcement why they are necessary. It does not detract from the war on terrorism for the government to admit when it has gone too far.  ',\n",
       " 'IMM-13809  PRIMARY  COUNTY JAILS HOUSING FEWER FEDERAL PRISONERS  The number of federal inmates in Wisconsin is dropping as federal immigration officials shift their focus from finding illegal immigrants to investigating reports of terrorist activities.  The average number of illegal immigrants detained in Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois has dropped this year from a high of 486 in March to a low of 397 on May 27, said John Longshore, interim director of the federal Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services\\' Chicago district, which covers the three states.  The number now is around 420.  The detainees are typically held in local county jails at federal expense while they await trial or deportation, and the drop in arrests means a subsequent drop in the amount of money for which jails are reimbursed.  Longshore did not know how many immigration inmates are currently held in the five Wisconsin jails with contracts -- Dodge, Kenosha, Ozaukee, Walworth and Waukesha counties.  In Ozaukee County, the number of immigration detainees has dropped to about 25, compared with about 75 in March, Sheriff Maury Straub said.  That loss means the county might not meet its $1.7 million revenue projection this year for housing federal inmates, Straub said.  \"The whole focus of investigation has shifted from immigration cases to more time-intensive terrorism investigations\" since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Longshore said.  If county jails remain less than full, officials could consider bringing back some of the nearly 2,300 Wisconsin inmates held in Oklahoma and North Dakota jails.  ',\n",

Law enforcement officials plan to make at least 12 structural changes that were recommended in a report issued last week by the Justice Department inspector general, according to interviews with officials at the agencies affected by the report. Nine other recommendations are being actively considered, they said.  The move to embrace the bulk of the changes appeared to signal a greater acknowledgment of shortcomings in antiterrorism and detention policies than Justice Department officials had publicly admitted.  The recommendations that law enforcement officials have signed off on go to the heart of the criticisms leveled by the inspector general, officials said, and could portend significant changes in how illegal immigrants suspected of terrorism are investigated, arrested and detained.  Inspector General Glenn A. Fine\\'s report found that few of the 762 illegal immigrants arrested after Sept. 11 had clear ties to terrorism, but that many were held for months in what the report characterized as harsh conditions, often without access to lawyers.

The study, by the Brookings Institution, provides the most detailed sketch yet of this region's foreign-born population, using 2000 Census data to delve into English proficiency, country of origin, poverty levels and the neighborhoods where immigrants live.  The portrait that emerges is one of a large, rapidly growing foreign-born community that is starkly different from those in cities such as New York or Los Angeles. Here, the report finds, there are no sprawling immigrant ghettos; instead, most of the foreign-born live in moderate- or high-income neighborhoods. Nearly 80 percent speak English well. And 10.6 percent are officially poor, about half the immigrant poverty rate of metro areas such as New York and Houston.  Still, the report emphasizes, the flood of newcomers is producing costs as well as benefits. The sheer size of the immigrant population -- 832,000 -- means there is a large number of people who don't speak English well. The number of students enrolled in English-as-a-second-language classes doubled from 1993 to 2001, reaching 54,000, the report says.

Cesare Reyes-Hernandez, 21, smiled broadly when, through a translator, he was told that prosecutors had insufficient evidence to charge him in the April 19 shooting that left 23-year-old Juan Carlos Herrera-Mora dead. He had been held on a charge of being an accomplice to second-degree murder.  Reyes-Hernandez won\\'t be released from jail, though.  Officials from the Bureau of Immigration, Customs and Enforcement have placed Reyes-Hernandez, Delfino Duran-Casas, 29, and Reymundo Reyes-Alfaro, 32, on \"detainers,\" which means that if they are released or post bail, they are to be taken into custody again to face deportation hearings.  Duran-Casas and Reyes-Alfaro pleaded not guilty Tuesday to second-degree murder and principle to second-degree murder charges, respectively, during arraignment in front of Circuit Judge Jack Springstead.  All of the suspects were arrested in Marion County, hours after authorities said they went to a mobile home on Ganz Drive, northwest of Brooksville, to collect a $300 debt from Miguel Reyes-Alfaro.  A fight ensued, with Reyes-Alfaro slashing Eusebio Gallegos-Olivo, 28, of Moon Road, west of Brooksville, from his ear to his shoulder, authorities said. Reyes-Alfaro was charged with attempted murder and pleaded not guilty in court Tuesday.  Gallegos-Olivo was taken to Oak Hill Hospital for his injuries.

The Rev. Ronald Marino, director of CMO, said he was looking for a used furniture store about three years ago when he stumbled into a sweatshop near CMO\\'s offices in Bensonhurst.  \"It was July, boiling hot, and there were at least 100 women at the sewing machines. There were fans, but there wasn\\'t a window in sight. The noise was incredible and there were little children sewing, which is against the law,\" he said.  \"The owner of the place was very proud of his shop,\" Marino said. The Diocese of Brooklyn priest, on the other hand, was outraged. \"I thought: \\'The church does wonderful work with immigrants. We have to do something about this. But what can we do?\\' \"  Marino came up with Resources.  The program offers training, internships and permanent jobs to 135 immigrants annually in three areas: computer graphics, culinary arts and residential and commercial cleaning.  Resources runs two small businesses a computer graphics firm and a commercial and residential cleaning company to provide jobs for the program\\'s graduates.  The Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty recently gave Resources a $ 10,000 award for \"effectively and compassionately meeting the needs of the most vulnerable in society.\"  Resources is the latest service offered by the Catholic Migration Office, which has been helping immigrants for 25 years.

       " 'IMM-13918  PRIMARY  College Tuition for Aliens  Melanie Scarborough\\'s analysis of Democratic Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner\\'s veto of legislation that would block in-state tuition for undocumented aliens [Close to Home, May 25] missed the target. Mr.  Warner\\'s veto was not partisan but consistent with the pending bipartisan federal Student Adjustment Act sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Chris Cannon (R-Utah). This act encourages states to grant in-state tuition to undocumented student aliens and to permit such persons to apply for permanent residency [news, May 22].  Ms. Scarborough cited concerns about nonpayment of payroll taxes by illegal workers but did not note that many such workers pay these taxes anyway using borrowed Social Security numbers, with no hope of ever collecting benefits. She further said that it is \"against the law to hire them [undocumented aliens]\" but omitted the fact that it is not against the law for undocumented aliens to work as independent contractors or to start U.S. businesses and hire U.S. citizens.  Finally, Ms. Scarborough questioned why it is in Virginia\\'s interest to send undocumented immigrants to college. The answer is obvious -- after spending tens of millions of dollars to educate all aliens from K-12 as required by the Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe (1982), it only makes sense for Virginia to finish the job with a college education for those who can gain acceptance.  ',\n",
       " 'IMM-13923  PRIMARY  Bad policy to consider breaks in illegal immigrants\\' tuition  Seven states have experienced heated legislative debate during the past two years over granting illegal immigrants in-state college tuition. It is absolutely incredible these states wasted time and money on such debate --- but the fact they did emphasizes how bold the radical open-borders lobby has become, even in the post-Sept. 11 era.  In recent weeks, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens signed a bill barring any such tuition break. In Virginia, the Legislature adopted a similar bill, only to see it vetoed by Gov. Mark Warner. All this followed the Maryland Legislature\\'s vote to grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants --- thankfully vetoed by Gov. Robert Ehrlich.  Interestingly, some black lawmakers joined conservatives in arguing that breaks for illegals come at the expense of underprivileged citizens who will face increased competition for slots at state colleges and universities.  Four states --- Texas, California, New York and Utah --- now allow undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition if they have attended high school in the state for at least three years.  The trend began in 1982, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states must provide a free high school education to every child, even those illegally on American soil. Paradoxically, in that same decision, the high court also said that \"like all persons who have entered the United States unlawfully, these children are subject to deportation.\" So if the feds don\\'t remove them, the taxpayers have to educate them.

       " 'IMM-1393  PRIMARY  On Multi-Cultural Education  The positive spin of your Feb. 11 article, \"Multi-Cultural Education: Immersion Lesson for Students,\" disguises some very troubling aspects of this movement. For starters, solicitude for immigrant or minority students is nowhere near as new as the article implies. It was present during the last major wave of massive immigration in the early 20th century, while teaching various perspectives has a long tradition in American education.  The multi-culturalist proponents tout the importance of learning of differing points of view. No problem there. The danger lies in pretending that all points of view are of equal significance or validity. In particular, the multi-culturalists suppress or deny the reality of an American point of view. Their programs presume only a variety of perspectives determined by group identity. Consequently, the reality of the American experience, which heretofore has assimilated immigrant populations and Americanized them -- with recognition for variation in degree -- is rejected. It is precisely this type of \"group-think\" which has led to the implementation of the ethno-racial quota system so despised by the majority of Americans.  Most strikingly, none of the various educational and multi-culturalist \"experts\" cited in the article demonstrates any concern to inculcate American history and heritage in immigrant children in order to aid in their assimilation of American culture. On the contrary, the multi-culturalist approach encourages immigrants to maintain their foreign traditions rather than adopting to American norms. The local multi-culturalists, and their many allies nationwide, have flipped the traditional assumption that immigrants should adjust to the American condition. In its place they propose, implicitly or explicitly, that Americans adjust to them -- a prescription for national suicide unique in world history.  ',\n",

He was guiding them from the jobless grind of Oaxaca, their poor southern state, to the U.S. border.  \"We\\'d rather work in Mexico,\" said Pozos, 28, as he related the details of his journey. \"But there\\'s no work here, so we have to try to cross.\"  Coyote, as human smugglers are called in Mexico, was charging $ 900 each to lead them through a sparsely populated area of western Arizona. They were farmers who didn\\'t know anything about their destination, Phoenix, except that they had friends there, who would get them jobs and pay for the trip.  Six days later, as Pozos and the others confronted life and death in the Arizona desert, they looked down at Coyote, lying unconscious in the sand.

Supporters of the self-described Palestinian freedom fighter say he has been kept behind bars for more than a year because of his outspoken activism against Israel, especially during appearances on WBAI radio.  But law enforcement authorities paint a very different picture. They say Abdel-Muhti is a con man who has claimed numerous names and birthplaces in a 40-year game of cat and mouse that has left federal immigration officials helpless in their efforts to deport him.  The only certainty is that Abdel-Muhti is a man without a country.  His story plays into several important issues beyond his control: the war on terrorism, the unresolved peace process in the Middle East, our open borders and the chronic failure of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, now known as the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, to keep track of known illegal aliens long before Sept. 11, 2001.  But Abdel-Muhti has contributed considerably to his own plight.  Since he first entered the country in 1963 from Honduras, records reviewed by the Daily News show, Abdel-Muhti has lied to judges, immigration agents, the FBI and police officers about his name, his date of birth, his country of birth, the number of times he has been married, his marital status, the number of children he has fathered and his criminal record.  \",\n",

Let Uncle Sam know  Government authorities have begun enforcing an old law that requires U.S. pleasure boaters returning from foreign shores to check in with immigration authorities - even if they\\'ve just been island-hopping in the Bahamas.  For years, boaters returning from a quick visit to another country could simply telephone Customs officials and be on their way. But since last year, officials have been enforcing a law that requires boaters to appear at a local immigration office within 24 hours of returning from a trip to a foreign country. Otherwise, they face a $3,000 fine.  Federal officials say national-security concerns leave them little choice.  \"Although it has always been the law, ports were using discretion,\" said Barbara Gonzalez, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. \"After Sept. 11, that changed. Everyone must report in person.\"  Quick boating trips are common in Florida, with the Bahamian island of Bimini only 55 miles away. Some boaters say the self-reporting policy only inconveniences law-abiding citizens and question its effectiveness.  \"To pack ourselves up, go there, and go through immigration, it becomes a real nuisance,\" said Bill Trentacoste, who recently drove 13 miles to check in after a Bahamas outing.  \"Let\\'s say I do have an illegal alien or whatever on the boat.

Noting that state regulations deny the benefit already (although some colleges ignore the regulation), Warner pronounced the measure a ploy \"to score a political victory against \\'illegal aliens.\\' \" At the same time, Warner rejected the suggestion of Del. Phillip Hamilton (R-Newport News) to extend in-state tuition rates to dependents of military personnel stationed in Virginia who have legal residency elsewhere.  Hmm. Advocates for illegal immigrants generally vote Democratic; members of the military tend to vote Republican. Exactly who is more intent on scoring a political victory?  Illegal immigration is an intractable problem because it can be neither discussed nor addressed. To mention its detriments invites accusations of xenophobia and racism.  Certainly, everyone sympathizes with the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. But pretending it is immaterial whether immigrants are here legally or illegally is to pretend that the invited guest is no different from the trespasser. Is Warner unable to discern the difference, or does he find it more politic to turn a blind eye?  Although illegal immigrants typically are hard workers, they still place a burden on taxpayers. As part of the underground economy, they often avoid payroll taxes. Moreover, much of what they earn isn\\'t recycled locally but is instead sent back to their native countries.

So when Ehrlich announced his veto of the bill yesterday, Menjivar was crushed.  \"I feel like all the doors are closing,\" she said. \"All my hard work is going to be wasted.\"  In explaining his veto of a bill that engendered passionate debate, Ehrlich (R) said he was concerned that the measure, by tacitly accepting illegal immigration, was part of a trend of \"slowly chipping away at the central goal of citizenship.\" He also said he was worried that the bill might violate a 1996 federal law barring states from providing illegal immigrant residents with low tuition rates not available to U.S. citizens who do not live in the state.

The campaign, which includes a toll-free tip line and posting photos and descriptions of fugitives on a Web site, is intended to aid the capture of dangerous criminal immigrants, said Homeland Security Undersecretary Asa Hutchinson.  He said the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement will spend $10 million on the expanded effort and double the number of fugitive apprehension teams nationwide to 16. The additional teams will be assigned to states with relatively large immigrant populations, including Georgia.  The effort focuses on the estimated 80,000 criminals who, by federal law, were supposed to have been removed from the country after serving their prison time. Hutchinson said the failure to deport these felons has been \"a historic problem\" for the federal government, which has not systematically monitored the nation\\'s prisons and jails.  Michael J. Garcia, acting director of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that before the law was tightened in 1996, felons who had aggravated offenses and who had served their prison time could be set free on bail, pending their deportation orders. Many then skipped bond and are still missing, Garcia said.  The new focus on criminal fugitives is not the first such campaign.

       " \"IMM-14029  PRIMARY  Homeland Security, Washington-Style  Here's a little something about homeland security that newly minted Secretary Tom Ridge may not know. The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, now an agency in Ridge's Department of Homeland Security, is doing a booming business in a neighborhood satellite office about a 10-minute drive from the White House.  Well, to be honest, it's a real stretch to say that the folks performing immigration and citizenship services at 17th and Fuller streets NW are on Ridge's payroll; they aren't. But according to longtime residents who keep a close eye on the streets, if you ever find yourself in need of a green card, a driver's license, a Social Security card or an ID card, you need only drive or walk to that Northwest Washington corner or along a three-block area of nearby Columbia Road and queue up to obtain -- for a fee -- all the documents you need to function as a citizen or legal immigrant in this country. (Warning: Saturdays and Sundays are their busiest days.)  The beautiful thing, at least from the point of view of the people trafficking in forged and illegal papers, is that there is no reason to worry about being caught, because (a) U.S. immigration officials hardly ever venture into the area, and (b) D.C. police, who literally speed through Fuller Street when they bother to go there at all, couldn't care less about false immigration documents -- that being a problem for the feds.  \",\n",

The Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for immigration and customs inspections at airports and other border crossings, has provided masks and gloves to thousands of its airport inspectors in the last month as part of the agency's effort to stem transmission of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which can be deadly.  At training sessions, officials said, the inspectors have been told that their screening duties now go beyond passports and baggage and that they need to give extra attention to the health of passengers arriving on 51 daily flights from Asian cities where the SARS outbreak has been most severe, including Beijing, Hong Kong and Singapore.  Officials said that the tightened screening procedures had gone into effect gradually in the last few weeks and that, so far, no airline passengers had required forcible detention, suggesting that the efforts of Asian governments and major airlines to prevent passengers infected with SARS from boarding trans-Pacific flights had been successful.  Under the new procedures, officials said, immigration and customs agents identifying arriving passengers who appear to be ill with any SARS symptoms, including high fever or breathing trouble, will be authorized to detain them and summon health inspectors.  \",\n",

The 5-to-4 decision upheld the mandatory-detention provisions of a 1996 immigration law as applied to a substantial category of aliens who are lawful permanent residents of the United States and who have been convicted of any of a number of drug crimes and other \"aggravated\" offenses.  Excerpts, Page A20.  The provision does not deal with terrorism, and the decision today has no direct application to the legal issues involving the detention and treatment of suspects under the USA Patriot Act that Congress passed after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But the decision was nonetheless notable for the degree of deference the majority showed to the judgments Congress made in 1996 about the desirability of detaining immigrants before deporting them.  Tens of thousands of these so-called \"criminal aliens\" have been imprisoned before deportation under the statute, which replaced a law giving the attorney general the discretion to release individuals on bond while their deportation cases went forward as long as they presented neither flight nor security risk.  Four federal appeals courts, including the San Francisco-based United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in this case, have declared the mandatory-detention provision unconstitutional at least as applied to lawful permanent residents, who have more rights than aliens who have not been lawfully admitted into the country.

Those who do not renew their outdated cards may not be eligible for new employment, government programs, foreign travel and other government services.

By 2050, the bureau said, immigration patterns and differences in birth rates, combined with a slowdown in growth of the country's population, will produce a United States in which 53 percent of the people will be non-Hispanic whites, down from 74 percent today.  In contrast, Hispanic people will make up 24.5 percent of the population, up from the current 10.2 percent, and Asians will make up 8.2 percent, an increase from the current 3.3 percent. The percentage of the black population will remain relatively stable, rising to about 13.6 percent by the year 2050 from the current 12 percent.  The population as a whole will rise to about 394 million from 262 million, an increase of 50 percent, the bureau said. Even with that increase, it added, the country would be going through some of the most sluggish population growth in its history.  Over all, the report suggests that the United States is experiencing one of the most dramatic shifts in its racial and ethnic makeup since the trade in slaves transformed the racial composition of the South and the waves of immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave an ethnic flavor to industrialized urban areas of the Northeast and Midwest.  \",\n",

That year, an estimated 935,000 legal immigrants were dropped from the welfare rolls. About a quarter million were reinstated in 1998, when Congress voted to soften the cuts.  A recent study by the Center for Immigrant Studies showed that about 6 percent of immigrant families got food stamps in 2001, just slightly higher than the percentage of native families.  Though immigrants make up disproportionate numbers of the nation's working poor, many illegal aliens and recent arrivals are still not eligible to receive aid.

       " 'IMM-14268  PRIMARY  Immigration Reform Growing at the Grassroots  Just days before Sept. 11, 2001, President Bush was committed to significantly overhauling the current immigration system - a system so broken that millions enter this country without a trace in a risky run across the border, and then work without permits and basic workplace protections.  In the two years since, Washington has made no grand gesture to reform immigration. Instead, a dragnet has swept across the land, detaining thousands of immigrants and secretly deporting hundreds. This de facto overhaul of the immigration system has become painful evidence that the nation Bush once described as \"more, not less, American\" because of its immigrants, has changed.  Yet, despite the new era of the Patriot Act and its threats of deportation, most illegal immigrants remain convinced that the chance for a better life here is still worth the risk. And, in part, what gives them hope in what some describe as one of the most hostile environments for immigrants in years, is the proliferation of small gestures on local and state levels that are making big differences in their lives.  These gestures are tacit recognition of the presence of illegal immigrants and their needs and contributions to society. They appeal to a community\\'s sense of justice and, little by little, they nudge along a federal system playing catch-up with the rest of the nation.  In Northern California, for instance, farmers in Napa County, home to a $4 billion wine industry, last year agreed to tax themselves to help provide better housing for their immigrant field workers, most of them Mexicans. Their intention: to make living conditions more humane for laborers they cannot do without.  ',\n",

Some farmers get their hired hands through the federal government\\'s H2A guest worker program, but Bone said he has all the help he needs in the cheaper illegal harvesters.  \"Face it, we\\'re in a world market,\" Bone said. \"We compete with other countries.\" As examples, he cited companies like Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds that save money buying tobacco from Brazil.  But Bone\\'s workers might become legalized after all. Up to 500,000 laborers could become legal residents of the United States if the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2003 passes. The president is expected to sign AgJobs, though detractors are still hoping it dies.  \"They\\'re traitors. They don\\'t care about American people -- law-abiding citizens,\" said Randy Lewis, whose Raleigh-based organization \"Stop the Invasion\" opposes adjusting the status of illegal farm workers.  According to Lewis, the high unemployment rate in the United States is proof that taking in large numbers of immigrants -- legal or not -- is counterproductive. His solution is a re-introduction of the Eisenhower Administration\\'s \"Operation Wetback,\" a search and seizure effort in the Southwest to expel Mexicans who had crossed the border illegally between 1949 and 1954. Phrases like \"guest worker,\" he said, are euphemisms for amnesty.  ',\n",

But she was afraid she would lose her job.  \"Is it bad to be part of a union?\" asked the 50-year-old Norristown worker, who did not want to be identified.  \"No,\" replied Sonia Burguillo, a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) organizer, who failed to convince the woman to greet a national Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride bus arriving in the area today.  Union organizers encounter this fear every day as they try to turn the labor movement\\'s new target audience - immigrants - into card-carrying members.  With membership steadily declining, unions are soliciting a burgeoning group long blamed for undercutting wages.  They are doing so largely on labor\\'s new frontier: suburban office complexes, hotels, and industrial parks that have drawn jobs over the last decade - and mass migrations of immigrant workers to fill them.  But in doing so, unions face tremendous odds - language barriers, scattered job sites, workers with often illegal residency status, and a management culture that will fight hard to keep unions out.  The Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride, a bus caravan that swings through Malvern and Philadelphia today en route to Capitol Hill on Thursday, is what organizers say is labor\\'s first loud declaration that it is embracing immigrant workers and the controversial immigration agenda as part of its political future.

Dever said Yeboah was \"doing well\" and living in a group home under contract with federal immigration officials.  Yesterday\\'s ruling is the latest round in a legal fight that began March 4, 2000, when Yeboah, then 10, arrived alone on an international flight that landed at New York\\'s John F.

A press conference at the El Centro Hispano offices in downtown Durham on Tuesday featured speakers and riders involved with the \"Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride.\" A bus will come through Durham Tuesday as others crisscross the country.

Durham County and the state saw a sharp rise in Hispanic populations during the boom 1990s. The influx stressed some counties\\' social services and schools, but the workers also helped propel the economy forward in this state when other states had such low unemployment rates that the lowest-level jobs went unfilled, supporters said.  A panel of speakers discussed the plight of immigrant workers Tuesday, some of whom live in substandard housing in agricultural worker situations. Some have children who attend and graduate from N.C. high schools but are not afforded in-state tuition benefits at state universities.

Apparently, a dose of common sense surfaced at the Department of Homeland Security. The department has delayed the deportations, which will allow the Hassan brothers to apply for temporary visas. It means Ahmad can go back to high school and his brother can return to junior college without fear, at least for now.  \"Maybe I can think about a university,\" Hassan said.  ',\n",

U.S. officials say the program, begun Sept. 8, is a humanitarian measure aimed at preventing returned migrants from simply attempting to cross again into Arizona, where many have died of exposure. Instead, U.S. officials are flying them as far east as Laredo, Tex., into more populated and less dangerous sections of the border.  The U.S. Embassy here said the pilot program, which concludes at the end of this month, has worked. Nearly 2,400 illegal immigrants have been taken from Arizona to Texas, and since the program began, no deaths have been reported in a desert that has averaged more than one death a day in recent years.  But Mexicans are upset over the so-called Lateral Repatriation Program, which has generated angry front-page headlines here in recent days. The Mexican Foreign Ministry has submitted an \"energetic\" protest of the program, in which captured immigrants are transported in handcuffs, to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez told the Mexican Congress last week that the government \"cannot agree\" with the plan.  While Derbez has not detailed the objections, analysts here said the plan poses a political nightmare for President Vicente Fox. They said the spectacle of U.S. officials flying handcuffed immigrants to distant ports for deportation is a public relations disaster for Fox, who took office promising to forge an agreement with Washington to make immigration to the United States safer and easier for Mexican workers.

In 1996, a law was passed requiring families to make 125% of the poverty level if they wanted to bring a relative into the United States. Currently, a family of four has to make $23,125 to sponsor a family. If the bill passes and becomes law, they will have to make $18,400, the federal poverty level.  Opponents of the bill argue that higher income thresholds mean immigrants are less likely to wind up on welfare.  \"The sponsor has to be able to assume the costs of shelter, food and health care,\" said David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"If they can\\'t, it will be a drain on federal funds.\"  Moises Perez, executive director of the Washington Heights-based community group Alianza Dominicana, disagreed, saying: \"We\\'re not seeing that immigrants are a burden across the country.\"  Instead, he said, under current restrictions, immigrant families have become disjointed.

       " 'IMM-14408  PRIMARY  STUDY: FOREIGN WORKERS KEEP U.S. COMPETITIVE; IMMIGRATION POLICY CENTER DEFENDS INFLUX OF H1-B HIRING  Curtailing immigration of skilled foreign professionals to theUnited States will hurt U.S. global competitiveness, inhibit innovation and job growth and send high technology and research jobs to other countries, according to a study.  The study says that while U.S. security must be protected, immigration policies should encourage and ease the legal flow of high- and low-skilled workers to keep the country competitive in recruiting talented workers.  Labor statistics  The study was conducted by the American Immigration Law Foundation\\'s Immigration Policy Center, a non-profit that supports immigration.  \"America\\'s strength lies in its openness,\" said Stuart Anderson, the study\\'s author.  Anderson said despite complaints that foreign workers are taking American jobs, statistics show that U.S. employers have not been rampantly hiring foreign workers who enter on H1-B visas for temporary workers with specialty occupations.  Anderson\\'s study found that H1-B hiring rises and falls with economic times, numbering 164,000 in 2001 and dropping to 79,100 in fiscal year 2002. The national H1-B worker cap of 195,000 a year is scheduled to be reduced to 65,000 a year on Oct. 1.  Employer abuse of the program to find cheap labor also is not widespread, he said. In 2002, the Department of Labor found only seven willful violations or required removal from the program, even though the agency has increased investigations, Anderson said.  The workers also help provide money for training Americans for high tech or engineering jobs. Employers pay a $1,000 per H1-B visa holder. In five years, $692 million has been collected. The money has been used to train 55,000 U.S. workers and to provide scholarships to 12,500 students studying in science and engineering fields, the study said.  ',\n",

Mayor Bloomberg\\'s decision to personally call one of his most outspoken critics on the issue, Councilman Hiram Monserrate of Queens, and to form a new group to try once more to reach a compromise reflects how politically sensitive the matter has become for him.  For years the city forbade its workers from disclosing information on a person\\'s immigration status to federal authorities, so as not to discourage illegal immigrants from reporting crimes, seeking medical help or getting other vital services. But after Congress changed the law, a federal court ruled that the city\\'s policy was illegal.  So the mayor issued a new policy, effectively replacing the old \"don\\'t tell\" one with a new \"don\\'t ask\" one in all but a few cases. But the outcry that greeted the decision might be enough by itself to frighten people without green cards from seeking city services. So he agreed to amend the policy. So far efforts to find common ground with the Council have failed.  ',\n",

With his political career and the support of Latino and union groups in the balance, Gov. Gray Davis is eager to sign a bill granting 2 million undocumented immigrants the right to a driver's license.  Too eager. By declaring a month ago he'd sign the bill, Davis greased the process for legislation that fails to meet demands he listed a year ago when he vetoed a similar bill.  Lying for a license  Here's the hole in the process: The bill still would enable individuals -- not just immigrants -- to get a license or multiple licenses by lying about who they are.  Barring last minute delays, the bill may go before the Assembly on Thursday, then return to the Senate. Unless senators have second thoughts, a bad bill with good intentions will become law.  California should become the third state, after Utah and New Mexico, to let undocumented immigrants drive legally, but must do so in a way that eliminates security risks.  A revised version of SB 60 is supposed to eliminate that problem byrequiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to purchase digital ID technology for $50 million to $65 million, which higher license and motor vehicle fees would pay for.  \",\n",

He had sold his gas station on Long Island to raise money for a sandwich-shop franchise in Toronto. His belongings were boxed up in the basement.

Then Sachdeva, a middle-class Hindu about to put a failed marriage and the United States behind him, did one last errand. He returned a call to the FBI, which wanted information about one of his Muslim workers.  That call ultimately landed him in a room with blackened windows in a New Jersey jail, where he sat for four months, caught in a net widely cast by federal agents investigating the Sept. 11 attacks.  Now Sachdeva, 31, a legal resident of Canada since 1998, is suing the U.S. government, as are six other men detained after Sept. 11. They contend they were treated like criminal suspects but denied the constitutional rights of defendants.  The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status on behalf of hundreds of similarly detained immigrants, alleges that the government held them longer than federal law allows on immigration charges, which are civil violations.

That vulnerability has inspired growing numbers of shady immigration consultants who bilk immigrants out of hard-earned cash only to file fraudulent documents or who fail to provide any services at all, as stories in Monday's and today's Mercury News show.  Hairstylists go through more rigorous training and licensing than immigration consultants, who offer to help immigrants with the confusing process of work permits, green cards and citizenship. Federal guidelines are needed to establish uniform requirements nationally and all consultants should hold a state license -- or be shut down.  Tighter controls would help curb widespread fraud. In addition to an onslaught of cases in immigration gateway cities -- Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles and New York -- corrupt consultants are cropping up in not-so-obvious places, including Atlanta, New Orleans and Denver.  Faced with the same issues, Canadian officials have taken a more aggressive approach, including requiring that consultants meet educational and character standards and obtain professional liability insurance. They also plan to create a compensation fund for fraud victims.  California requires consultants to post a $50,000 bond and prohibits them from dispensing legal advice. But stricter licensing procedures would allow the state to require training, do background checks and make it easier to crack down on fraud.  In Santa Clara County, which has one of the more impressive records for catching consultant fraud, the district attorney's office also advocates extending the statute of limitations in these fraud cases from one year to four, and requiring the secretary of state to notify the district when bonds are canceled or expired.  \",\n",

The state took in the second-largest number of foreign-born people between 1995 and 2000 with 584,000, after California's 1.2 million.  Only about 205,000 of New York's new arrivals left for other states - including North Carolina and Georgia, which saw their foreign-born population jump 200% between 1990 and 2000.  New York saw a large net growth in foreign-born people in the 1995 to 2000 period.  According to the 2000 head count, the city has the largest number of immigrants of any city in the nation - 2.9 million, or 36% of the 8 million people who live here.  Overall, Census 2000 showed that the foreign-born population in the country was 31.1 million, a 57% increase from 1990.  California and New York, both traditional gateway states, played major roles in the redistribution of the immigrant population in the United States.

       " 'IMM-14567  PRIMARY  Immigrants Fear Deportation After Registration; Number of Mideast, Muslim Men Expelled Rises Sharply  Andre Aniba acknowledges he hasn\\'t always played by the rules. In 1998, the former pastry chef came to the United States from Tunisia on a three-month tourist visa. He has lived here ever since.  But when Congress passed legislation two years later that allowed illegal immigrants to apply for permanent residency, Aniba quickly sent in the proper forms.  Early this year, when the government called on visitors from 25 nations that are considered havens for terrorists to register with immigration authorities, he dutifully appeared.  To his horror, Aniba, whose application to work as a chef at a Maryland restaurant was pending, was told he would be deported.  His experience was hardly exceptional. With little public notice outside immigrant communities, the government is moving to deport the largest number of visitors from Middle Eastern and other Muslim countries in U.S. history -- more than 13,000 of the nearly 83,000 men older than 16 who complied with the registration program by various deadlines between last September and April.  When they showed up, they were found in violation of immigration laws -- even though, like Aniba, many were already participating in the government-sponsored program to become legal residents.  \"The sheer numbers are mind-boggling,\" said Sohail Mohammed, an attorney in Clifton, N.J., who handles many of the cases and says Muslims are being unfairly singled out in the tightening of immigration procedures after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \"We could end up deporting almost as many Muslims in one year as we have in the last 10. And to me that shows that we\\'re not administering our immigration laws fairly.\"  ',\n",

Gone are the days in which they were a remarkable curiosity. Atlanta is a growing and maturing international community.  From 1990 to 2000, the 20-county metro area\\'s foreign-born population jumped 278 percent, to 423,105, according to the Census Bureau. Some of that growth is reflected in the already established multicultural strongholds along Buford Highway, in Chamblee and Doraville. The increased presence is not limited to those areas, however. From Carroll and Douglas counties on Atlanta\\'s west to Rockdale and Walton on the east, from Coweta on the south to Forsyth and Pickens on the north, the number of residents born in other countries has skyrocketed.  \"It\\'s no longer just the core counties that are growing,\" said Jeffrey Humphreys, director of economic forecasting at the University of Georgia. \"Immigrants are settling in the suburban communities, not only because that is where affordable housing is, it is where the jobs are.\"  The suburbs also are where good schools are, said Lily Lee, who settled in Gwinnett 20 years ago, mainly because she felt the schools would provide her son with a good education. Originally from China, Lee still lives in the Peachtree Corners community she moved to in 1983.  Accompanying the growth in immigrant population has been an equally staggering growth in those communities\\' buying power, Humphreys said. The buying power of metro Atlanta\\'s Hispanic population surged 711 percent between 1990 and 2002, compared with a 160 percent increase nationally. The buying power of the Asian population here jumped 358 percent, compared with 152 percent nationally, he said.  ',\n",

He wants to end the program - or at least reduce the number of  available work permits to 5,000 per year.  H-1B visas allow foreigners to work in the United States for up to  six years. Experts estimate about 90,000 of the permits will be  issued this year, about half the number that are available.  Tancredo and the unemployed tech workers backing him argue that  tech companies abuse the program to hire foreigners who will work  for as little as half of what Americans demand.  The H-1B visa program doesn't require companies to attempt to first  recruit American workers.  'I want to make it much more difficult to import cheap labor when  there are American citizens who need jobs,' Tancredo said. 'I  want American workers first in line.'

According to Mexico\\'s central bank, remittances reached a record $2.74 billion in the first quarter of 2003 --- a 26 percent jump from last year. Total remittances are expected to exceed last year\\'s $10 billion, a figure based solely on electronic transfers. Many observers say that figure underestimates money flow because it doesn\\'t take into account remittances by money orders, personal checks and cash.  Supporters of immigrants praise these workers for sending money back home.  But critics of U.S. immigration policies hold another view. They argue that money crossing the border means fewer dollars circulate in the local economy.  Studies have shown that Mexicans send home an average monthly stipend of $300 to $400. Most are recently arrived illegal immigrants who perform manual labor in cities such as Atlanta.  Such a profile fits Mario Cantu, who makes about $300 a week.  He wires half of that amount to his wife and three children in Monterrey, Mexico. The rest he keeps for himself to pay bills in Gwinnett County, his home away from home.  \"I feel sorry and bad when I can\\'t send anything,\" said Cantu, 35, speaking through an interpreter while waiting for work at a Duluth labor hall.

Lobbyists working with the White House said Bush is developing a plan that would allow immigrants to cross the border legally if jobs are waiting for them. The sources said the administration also wants to provide a way for some undocumented workers in the United States to move toward legal status.  Bush will try to make the plan more palatable to conservatives by including stricter entry controls, including increased use of technology at the border and steps toward better enforcement of current visa restrictions and reporting requirements, sources said.  Bush said at his year-end news conference last week that he was preparing to send Congress recommendations for an \"immigration policy that helps match any willing employer with any willing employee.\" He said he is \"firmly against blanket amnesty,\" or a mass legalization.  An estimated 8 million undocumented people live in the United States. At least half of them are Mexican, authorities said.  White House aides would not provide details of the proposal, but the Republican officials said it draws on, among other sources, a bill introduced by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). It would create a Web-based job registry, to be run by the Labor Department.

Nevertheless, his comments unleashed a mini-storm of abuse, as well as a rather unclear White House clarification. Last week President Bush declared himself firmly against \"blanket amnesty\" but called for an immigration policy that \"helps match any willing employer to any willing employee,\" whatever that means. Although rumor has it that the president intends to propose legislation that would expand the use of temporary visas, which would help bring undocumented workers out of the illegal economy, senior administration officials will not confirm or deny it.

The kidnappers stash the immigrants in hundreds of drop houses scattered around this city, using violence and threats to extort money from their relatives.  Now smuggling gangs are fighting back, shooting it out with kidnappers on sidewalks and freeways in broad daylight.  A gun battle last month between kidnappers and smugglers on Interstate 10 at the height of rush hour left four dead. Four others were killed this month in the desert near Phoenix; authorities blamed the deaths on violence between the two groups.  Kidnappers operate simply enough; they let smugglers take all the risks of getting immigrants into the country, then rob them once they get here. When they can\\'t intercept smugglers on the road, they snatch migrants from houses where they are hiding.

He said it was too early to suggest that White House aides or other senior officials had been derelict.  \"There were people at the borders who let these people in even though they didn\\'t have proper papers to get into this country,\" Mr. Kean said of immigration inspectors who allowed the hijackers into the United States.  \"There were visa people who let these people in,\" he said. \"There were F.B.I. people who, when they got reports from Phoenix and Minnesota and elsewhere, didn\\'t think they were important enough to buck up to the higher-ups. There were security officers at the airports who let these people onto airplanes even though they were carrying materials that weren\\'t allowed on airplanes.\"  Mr. Kean said an interview that was broadcast Wednesday by CBS News was being misinterpreted as suggesting that he was calling for the departure of senior administration officials.

       " 'IMM-147  PRIMARY  GOP EASES STANCE ON LEGAL-MIGRANT AID  House Republican leaders, who Tuesday unveiled a revised welfare reform bill, have decided to allow legal immigrants who have not become citizens much greater access to federal assistance than they originally proposed.  Non-citizens would still be barred from receiving aid under the five largest federal programs: Medicaid, food stamps, disability aid, the revamped Aid to Families With Dependent Children and social-service programs known as \"Title XX.\" But, unlike legislation approved in recent weeks by House committees, the new bill would not bar legal immigrants from receiving aid under dozens of other federal programs, including education and training, lead screening and elderly assistance.  The revised bill, which was introduced earlier this week, is a consolidated form of legislation that three committees -- Ways and Means, Economic and Educational Opportunities, and Agriculture -- have approved in recent weeks. The committees have voted to overhaul the nation\\'s welfare system, replacing numerous federal programs with direct cash payments to the states.  Congressional aides said the changes were made in part to allow immigrants access to programs -- such as employment and training -- that will help them improve their status. But immigrant-advocacy groups say the change has done little to soften their opposition to the welfare reform.  \"We were completely against the bill as it stood and are completely against it as it stands,\" said Robert Almanzan, director of communications for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \"It\\'s still unjust.\"  ',\n",
       " 'IMM-14704  PRIMARY  INTO THE LIGHT, AND SAFER  Migrant workers are ideal targets for crime. They tend to carry cash. Many of them walk alone through tough neighborhoods. When victimized, they often are reluctant to contact authorities because of concerns about their immigration status.  The reporting problems make it difficult to assess how prevalent crimes against migrants have become in South Florida. But law-enforcement agencies from the Treasure Coast to Palm Beach County acknowledge that they have their hands full preventing this largely undocumented, itinerant population from falling prey to criminals.  This month, Lake Worth police officers took aggressive, pro-active measures in defense of migrants with an undercover sting operation aimed at thwarting recent increases in street crimes against Hispanic and Mayan workers. The police used two Spanish-speaking officers who posed as migrants in the city\\'s downtown. One of the undercover officers wore a gold bracelet and watch, and before long, he attracted two male teenagers. Police say they tried to take the jewelry. A backup team arrested the suspects and charged them with robbery by sudden snatching.  Police say the incident reflects other assaults in which groups of teenagers targeted migrants. \"We want these suspects to think twice,\" said Sgt. Daniel Boland, \"because next time they try this, it could be a police officer involved.\"  Another way to deter the mugging of migrants is to encourage them to put their money in banks instead of their pockets. Several South Florida banks - including Wachovia, Bank of America, Washington Mutual and SunTrust - have begun accepting the Mexican matricula consular identification cards, so migrants can open accounts. More than 100 cities and counties across the nation have recognized the cards, which the Mexican government issues for its nationals living in the United States. The Palm Beach County Sheriff\\'s Office, the Sarasota sheriff and several local governments in Miami-Dade County have endorsed the cards. Last year, the Lake Worth City Commission thought about it, then voted 3-1 against recognizing the cards. Cities that allow use of the IDs say they encourage cooperation with law enforcement and help police resolve identity disputes.  ',\n",

The proposal -- part of a broad push by the Bush administration to more closely monitor foreign nationals since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- is raising concerns among some civil liberties advocates and law enforcement groups that fear it will bring police heavily into the business of  apprehending immigration violators who have committed no serious crimes. In some cases, they said, that could violate state rules that prohibit police from enforcing federal immigration laws.  Spokesman Jorge Martinez stressed that the Justice Department has not yet made a decision on the plan.  Under the proposal, the FBI's main fugitive database would be expanded to include the names of 140,000 immigrants who are deported each year for noncriminal reasons, officials said. An unknown number return to the country and are here illegally. Authorities also would add the names of thousands of foreign students who do not show up for class or otherwise violate their visas.  The FBI's database, known as the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), includes the names of more than 40 million felons, fugitives, missing persons and others being sought by law enforcement agencies. It is used by more than 80,000 law enforcement agencies.  \",\n",

Beginning in the new year, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will require more than proof of one\\'s address and identity before issuing a license: Applicants will also have to prove that they are not illegal immigrants.  For U.S. citizens, that means presenting a passport or birth certificate. For those born elsewhere, it gets more complicated.  DMV agents could be called on to examine thousands of different immigration documents from applicants trying to verify their legal status -- everything from foreign passports to papers guaranteeing political asylum. And the more time agents spend examining those papers, officials say, the longer the lines will be for everyone.  Officials at DMV are preparing for the new \"legal presence\" requirement and have spent $2 million to hire more personnel, train staff to recognize immigration documents and educate the public about the change. Only those seeking new licenses or renewing expired licenses will be required to show proof of legal U.S. residency. So DMV officials are urging customers in need of other services to avoid local branches, if possible, by doing business on DMV\\'s Web site or by phone.  Sponsors of the bill predict that the wait could grow at branches, especially in Northern Virginia, where the lines are already the longest in the state and the concentration of immigrants is the highest. Of particular concern are what the DMV refers to as its four \"hot spots,\" where the wait typically reaches 45 minutes to an hour: Alexandria, Arlington County, Tysons Corner and Woodbridge.  ',\n",

As part of the grade\\'s social studies curriculum, teachers and parents staged a simulation of Ellis Island. About 150 students participated in the learning experience, which required them to research their assigned homelands and then assume the roles of immigrants seeking entry into the United States.  Whether they hailed from Italy, Scotland, Ireland, Greece, Russia or Jamaica, most immigrants came with hopes of a better life, said fifth-grader Brittany Mitcham, a student in Melanie Mount\\'s social studies class. \"Many were fleeing wars or famines in their native countries,\" said Brittany. \"Their lives were very difficult, and they were looking for work and a chance to make a better life.\"  Not everyone who tried made it to the promised land, the students learned.

Sometimes, undocumented aliens get their Social Security cards from the same people you do - your local Social Security office worker.  \"It\\'s rare,\" said Social Security spokesman Mark Lassiter, when you consider there are 65,000 workers in 1,300 Social Security field offices around the country. But one bad employee can do a lot of damage.  In December, a worker in the Arlington, Texas, office was indicted for his role in counterfeiting more than 1,700 cards for $2,500 apiece. In November, a 43-year-old claims adjuster in the Atlanta office was one of 28 people indicted in a ring that issued 1,900 cards to undocumented immigrants.  This year alone, two Social Security employees in Palm Beach County were charged in two separate cases with processing and arranging delivery for about 400 illegal cards.  On Feb. 11, Walther Velasquez, 38, an employee at a Social Security office in Delray Beach, was arrested after trying to persuade a co-worker to help him process and sell cards. According to court records, Velasquez offered to pay $1,000 per card to a co-worker to help him process paperwork. Velasquez said he had a source in Boston who would supply him with biographical information to use on the cards. After processing the paperwork, the cards would be sent to a middleman, who would then sell them to undocumented immigrants.  Shortly after Velasquez posted bond, agents searched his apartment on South Dixie Highway in West Palm Beach. As they opened the door, they found Velasquez holding a garbage bag containing a hot dog, a cigar laced with marijuana and the torn-up biographical information of prospective illegal applicants. On a table, the agents found stacks of blank Social Security card applications.  ',\n",

Of the major slavery cases involving farm workers prosecuted in the U.S. in the past decade, most have been in Florida and have involved contractors. In some cases, contractors pay off smugglers who bring workers into the country and then lock up workers or threaten them until they work off those debts.  \"Everybody knows that the worst places to go to work in the States are the big cities and the state of Florida,\" says Juventino Calva, 25, a migrant worker interviewed in Mexico who was heading to Missouri.  Advocates for migrants say Florida\\'s poor reputation is due, in large part, to the fact that contractors serve as the employers of farm workers, as opposed to direct employment by growers. In Florida, 50.4 percent of migrants work for contractors, as compared to 20.6 percent elsewhere in the U.S., a federal study states.  \"The reason that growers use contractors is to distance themselves,\" says Raul Barrera of the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project in Florida. \"The growers use it as a way to hire undocumented workers and avoid liability.\"  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in the past four years, Florida labor contractors were cited 916 times for failure to pay wages when due, 464 times for failure to provide safe transport vehicles, 442 times for failure to present workers with proper wage statements, and 431 instances of interfering with federal investigators - among other violations. Most violations draw warnings, not fines. Of 6,605 violations recorded by DOL inspectors the past four years, only 869 drew fines, and the average penalty was less than $300.  ',\n",

Experts cited liberalized U.S. immigration laws and unrest in the Middle East as leading many people to come to America.  The bureau counted nearly 1.2 million Arabs in the United States in 2000, compared with 860,000 in 1990 and 610,000 in 1980. About 60 percent trace their ancestry to three countries: Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.  While earlier Arab immigrants came from countries with large Christian populations, newer arrivals come from heavily Muslim countries such as Iraq and Yemen.  \"Immigrants from the Arab world come for the same reason all immigrants come - economic opportunity, opportunities to have an education, to develop a professional career,\" said Helen Samhan, executive director of the Arab American Institute Foundation, a research group.  Samhan said the lifting of U.S. immigration quotas in the 1960s opened the door to people from Arab countries. Many took advantage during the 1980s and 1990s, with a large number coming from nations such as Lebanon and Iraq, where there were wars.  Almost half of the Arabs in the United States live in five states - California (190,890), New York (120,370), Michigan (115,284), New Jersey (71,770) and Florida (77,461).  \"It would be better to come to America than Europe or Canada,\" said Zak Trad, 33, of Anaheim, Calif., who came from Lebanon three years ago. \"It\\'s the largest Arab community not in an Arab country.

They sent in their paperwork, completed the required medical and background checks, and met with a caseworker multiple times. Even the Bulgarian government finished its end of the deal. But it took the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, formerly Immigration and Naturalization Services, five months to process the request.  For Americans like the Miners, who want to adopt children overseas, the process might soon get easier. The U.S. government is considering changes that could transform how it handles international adoptions.  The number of Americans adopting foreign children has tripled in the last 10 years to more than 21,000 last year, the federal agency says. Parents spend $15,000 to $25,000 and take about one to three years to adopt overseas, according to the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse. Of the 1.6 million people adopted in the United States, 15 percent were adopted abroad, the U.S. Census Bureau says.  And the government hasn't ignored the issue. In 1994, the United States signed the Hague Convention, an international law designed to standardize adoption procedures.

The interest was so great that even Jay Hershenson, CUNY\\'s vice chancellor for university relations, who said he always expected the event to be a success, was caught by surprise.  \"This is the first time that an institution of higher learning has done something like this, and we are striking a real chord with this program,\" said Hershenson, who called the seminars \"my baby.\"  When people go to the offices of their elected officials seeking help to navigate the maze of immigration regulations, Hershenson said, usually the staff is not trained to give them effective answers. In a city that is 40% foreign-born, this is an everyday occurrence.  \"There is an unmet need in the city,\" he added, \"and we want to meet it.\"  ',\n",

Such holidays were foreign to my immigrant family, so my parents extended their own traditions.  Instead of stuffing ourselves with sleep-inducing meat, we ate the Chinese version of holiday food, huokuo, or hot pot. The effect was the same -- the whole family gathered around food and ate ourselves silly. But overall I think our meal was healthier and, for me, even tastier.  Hot pot is traditionally eaten on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve. The communal activity represents the bond of the family, which gathers around a warm pot to share good wishes for the coming year.  International flavor  The dish is just what it sounds like: a hot pot of boiling water or broth into which food is dipped and cooked.  According to \"Food Lover\\'s Companion,\" each country has its own version of hot pot. The English have a Lancashire hot pot that includes mutton, sheep kidneys, oysters and potatoes. The French hot pot or hochepot contains pig\\'s ears and feet.  The Asian version of hot pot originated in northern China, where the dish helped fend off the chill of harsh winters. The Japanese hot pot, or shabu-shabu, is named after the sound made when meat is swished through the broth. It tends to be lighter in flavor than the Korean hot pot, which contains more garlic and pepper, or the Thai hot pot, which includes more hot, sour and sweet tastes.  ',\n",

The sponsor of SB 60, Sen. Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles Democrat, finally is willing to compromise. But Schwarzenegger must be willing to listen. So far, he has refused.  Schwarzenegger figures he doesn't have to negotiate. He knows that iflegislators don't repeal the law, voters will. Opponents are gathering signatures to put rescission on the March ballot.  Although it passed the Legislature last year for the third time, the bill is unpopular outside Sacramento. Two-thirds of voters at last month's recall election told pollsters they opposed it, and some cited Gov. Davis' signature as a reason to give him the boot.  That was even before the recent prediction that hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers will crowd understaffed DMV offices to take their driving tests after the law takes effect Jan. 1, causing delays of up to six months for Californians to get a license.

The federal court lawsuit seeks class-action status for perhaps thousands of immigrants, legal and illegal, hired by the contractors to clean the stores of the world\\'s largest retailer, said a lawyer for the plaintiffs, James L.

The scheme by Wal-Mart and the contractors violated the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, by systematically depriving the workers of labor law protections over at least the past three years, according to the lawsuit.  \"It\\'s all designed to exploit the weakest, most vulnerable people in the world,\" Linsey said Tuesday, a day after the lawsuit was filed. He said the action replaces a lawsuit filed in state Superior Court last week by the same workers that sought more than $200,000 in back pay.  The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction barring Wal-Mart from further violations.  The nine named plaintiffs, all from Mexico, were among 250 people arrested Oct. 23 by federal immigration agents during raids at 60 Wal-Mart stores in 21 states.

Claudia would be the teacher, she recalled, and together they would look up words.  \"I\\'d write out the definitions and memorize them,\" she said, \"and my English just kept getting better.\"  Claudia\\'s recent certification as a fluent English speaker was a milestone for her and for her school, Butler Elementary, which like thousands of others across the nation has become eager to help students learn English as quickly as possible because a new federal law imposes sanctions on schools that do not.  But because of what experts call a Catch-22 in the law, Butler Elementary will obtain no credit for Claudia\\'s achievement.  Under the law, school districts must show improvement in many categories of students, including those who have limited English proficiency.

The program is administered on an annual basis by the U.S. Department of State to provide for a new class of immigrants known as \"diversity immigrants\" (DV immigrants). The program makes available 50,000 permanent resident visas annually to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.  The annual DV program makes permanent residence visas available to people meeting the simple, but strict, eligibility requirements. A computer-generated random lottery chooses the applicants for the diversity visas.  The visas are distributed among six geographic regions, with a greater number of visas going to regions with lower rates of immigration, and with no visas going to citizens of countries that have sent more than 50,000 immigrants to the U.S. in the past five years. Within each region, no one country can receive more than 7 percent of the available visas in one year.  Applications are accepted from Nov. 1 to Dec. 30. Registration will be accepted online. Finland is a country with a low rate of immigration to the U.S. and its citizens qualify to participate in the program.  - Entry requirements: The applicant must be a citizen of a country that qualifies. In most cases this means the country in which the applicant was born. However, if a person was born in a country whose citizens are ineligible but his/her spouse was born in a country whose citizens are eligible, that person can claim the spouse\\'s birth country providing both the applicant and spouse are issued visas and enter the U.S. simultaneously.

But there they were, alone on a hot August evening at a United States immigration checkpoint, surrounded by law enforcement officers wearing badges and guns. Eight-year-old Jose Cruz Velazquez held the hand of his brother Sergio, who was 6.  The Mexican boys had been seized from a smuggler hired by their parents living without legal papers in Pennsylvania. They were two of a growing number of children traveling without families who have been snared in the net that American and Mexican agents cast to stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border.  Authorities attribute the trend to aggressive American law enforcement operations during the past decade that have effectively sealed long sections of the 2,000-mile border. The blockade was further reinforced after the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The tightened security has made it much harder for illegal immigrants to move back and forth across the border, disrupting long-established migration patterns.  Immigrants who lack American documents have been forced to cross through remote desert. Smugglers who lead them, called coyotes, have tripled their fees in the last decade, experts said.  As a result, parents living in the United States illegally find increasingly that they can no longer afford the growing risks and expense of returning home to retrieve their children. They face a harsh choice: either they allow others to raise their children far away, or they hire strangers to smuggle their children into the United States.  ',\n",

The study doesn't measure what has happened since the 2000 Census,  but the trends it studied, if anything, have worsened since then.  Here's the way it works: The census counts everyone, citizens,  legal immigrants and illegal immigrants alike. The totals are then  used as the basis for redrawing the boundaries of all congressional  districts. In the resulting shuffle, some states gain seats while  others lose or remain the same.

The immigrant is a 16-year-old boy from Mexico who moved to Austin in 2002 to live with his brother and had the transplant last spring at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, the lawsuit said. He was not identified.  When the boy had the transplant, illegal immigrants were eligible for the Medical Assistance program, which covered transplants and anti-rejection drugs. But after legislative budget cuts, the boy lost his benefits July 1, qualifying only for emergency medical care that pays for dialysis but not the drugs.  The lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in Ramsey County District Court, said the state refuses to pay $1,400 per month for the drugs, but the federal government will probably pay $3,600 per month for his dialysis.  Wes Kooistra, deputy commissioner of the Human Services Department, declined to comment on the specifics of the case. But he added, \"We believe we have a tentative agreement that responsibly addresses the urgency of the case, and provides the necessary time for all parties to review and consider the facts.\" The boy\\'s lawyers, Liz Kramer and Byron Starns, also declined to comment.

Both decisions were approved 4-1, with Councilman John Best Jr. dissenting and members Lewis Cheek and Tamra Edwards absent.  Council members who supported the immigration policy called it a matter of human rights and said valuable city resources should not be spent checking people\\'s immigration status. Supporters of the policy also said it would improve relations and trust between immigrants and local authorities. For example, one supporter argued, immigrants who are victims of domestic violence might be more willing to report that violence if they knew their immigration status wouldn\\'t be an issue.  ',\n",

Oberweis is staking his hopes in his second campaign for the Senate on illegal immigration - an issue on which he has split from Republican President George W. Bush.  The dairy owner warns in two television commercials that 10,000 illegal aliens come to the United States each day to take jobs and get free health care, which he contends will be paid for by taxpayers. The ads, which began airing statewide Tuesday, have angered some immigrant rights groups.  \"Jim Oberweis is a phony, and I hope people will see through it,\" said Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. \"Two years ago, he ran as a moderate Republican. He lost. This time, he\\'s coming back as a straight-talking conservative and picking on immigrants.\"  The ads also might be a sign of a growing conservative split over Bush\\'s plan to grant legal status to millions of immigrant workers who are in the country illegally. He would offer three-year \"temporary worker\" status but not a chance at citizenship. Mike Lawrence, interim director of the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University, said Oberweis is attempting to \"develop an issue that will resonate with voters who typically vote in Republican primaries, and they tend to be more conservative than mainstream Republicans.\"  ',\n",

Schools Is Said To Be First in Nation  A federal judge in Alexandria ruled yesterday that Virginia\\'s colleges and universities may deny admission to illegal immigrants -- a ruling that experts said was the first of its kind in the nation.  The decision by U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III came in a lawsuit filed against seven Virginia schools accused of violating the rights of the immigrants by refusing them entry.  \"It is clear that denying illegal aliens admission to public colleges and universities simply removes another public incentive for illegal immigration,\" Ellis wrote. He stopped short of dismissing the case, however, ruling that it could proceed to trial because the plaintiffs have a right to try to prove whether the schools are using federal standards to identify applicants who are in the country illegally.  Virginia Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore (R), who is defending the schools, said he was pleased by the ruling. Kilgore\\'s 2002 memo to Virginia\\'s public colleges and universities, which urged them to reject illegal immigrants, was one impetus for the lawsuit, Ellis wrote. The suit was filed in September in U.S. District Court in Alexandria.  \"Legal immigration has made this country what it is,\" Kilgore said in a statement. \"I continue to believe that it is not too much to ask that people obey the laws of our society before they take advantage of what our society has to offer.\"  ',\n",

On Monday, the nation\\'s highest court agreed to hear arguments in the case of Keyse G. Jama, who contends federal officials are ignoring a 50-year-old law that prohibits the deportation of an immigrant to his homeland without the approval of that country\\'s government.  To send him back now, the 25-year-old Jama argues, would be equivalent to giving him a death sentence. For almost four years he has been locked up while fighting to avoid returning to his homeland.  But attorneys with the U.S. Department of Justice\\'s Civil Division, Office of Immigration, have countered that the government has the authority to remove any foreign national the courts have ordered to leave because of criminal convictions or violations of immigration law.  Jama, who came here in 1996 as a 17-year-old refugee, is subject to removal because of a third-degree assault conviction stemming from a 1999 fight in Hennepin County. He completed his criminal sentence in June 2000 but has been in immigration custody since that time.  This case, which is being followed closely by Somalis locally and nationwide, has resulted in divergent opinions from two federal appeals courts -- one siding with Jama\\'s argument, the other with the government.  \"I am optimistic about this,\" said Saeed Fahia, executive director of the Minneapolis-based Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota. \"It is good that (the Supreme Court) wants to listen to the argument.

       " 'IMM-15036  PRIMARY  LATINOS GET THE MOST NEW JOBS  WASHINGTON -- Latinos landed a disproportionate share of new jobs created last year, and most of those jobs went to very recent immigrants, according to a private foundation\\'s report issued Monday.  More than half of the jobs were in construction, and most of the rest were in agriculture and business services -- much of it low-paying work requiring little English language skill. The Washington, D.C.-based Pew Hispanic Center, a nonprofit research group, found the gains greatest among Latinos who arrived in the United States after 2000. The findings are based on an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau data.  Overall, the number of employed Latinos rose by almost 660,000 between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003. The total was 17.7 million, which included unknown numbers of illegal workers.  By comparison, the non-Latino work force, which consisted of 121 million workers at last year\\'s end, scored a net increase of 371,066 jobs.  According to Harry Holzer, professor of public policy at George Washington University in Washington, employers prefer \"more appreciative and less demanding\" immigrants.  \"It is a form of discrimination, in a way, in favor of the foreign-born workers,\" said Holzer, who studies ethnicity and low-wage work.  In 2003, Hispanic unemployment declined from a June peak of 8.2 percent to 6.6 percent in December, Pew reported.  By comparison, according to the recent study by the National Urban League, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 10.3 percent in December 2003.

Mohamed Kamel Bellahouel, 34, an Algerian immigrant, was detained on a visa violation in October 2001, then turned over to the FBI as a material witness after it developed that he had waited on a table occupied by some of the Sept. 11 hijackers at a Middle Eastern restaurant in the Miami area.  He was released on bond in March 2002 after testifying before a grand jury, but the government still sought to deport him -- and got both a federal  district court in Florida and the Atlanta-based federal appeals court that heard Bellahouel's constitutional challenge to the deportation to agree  they would not publicly acknowledge that the matter had even been before them.  Bellahouel had asked the Supreme Court to rule that the official blackout over his case violated the public's First Amendment right of access to court proceedings. Courts may not conduct proceedings in secret without  providing a public explanation for doing so, Bellahouel's lawyers argued.

Buchanan  Market: Arizona  Producer: Townsend Group  Time: 30 seconds  Audio: Each year millions of illegal immigrants pour across our southern border into the United States. Most come without job skills. Crime explodes. And who pays the cost of their health care, housing, welfare? You do, thanks to one unelected federal judge. I\\'ll term-limit these federal judges. Declare a time-out on new immigration. Secure America\\'s borders. And insist on one language, English, for all Americans.  Analysis: With its night-vision shots of scurrying figures, hole-ridden fences and the arrest of a young Mexican in a T-shirt, this ad has an urgent, disturbing feel. Buchanan\\'s assertion of \"millions\" of illegal immigrants each year is way off; federal authorities estimate the annual figure at 300,000. He is right that illegal immigrants are eligible for welfare and other benefits, but the ruling by \"one unelected federal judge\" applies only to the battle over California\\'s Proposition 187. (The Supreme Court in 1982 barred the states from denying public education to children of illegal immigrants.) Buchanan slides seamlessly from attacking illegal immigrants to cutting off legal immigration by proposing a temporary ban (\"time out\") on all immigration, sidestepping arguments that legal immigrants have helped the U.S. economy. He hits another hot button by calling for an English-only law that is likely to be popular in border states such as Arizona.  ',\n",
       " \"IMM-15052  PRIMARY  The reality of temporary worker plan  There are two truths and one falsehood behind President Bush's  proposed temporary worker program. The first truth is that we, as a  nation, aren't willing to let in everyone who wants to come. This  means we have to choose who gets in.  This is an important choice. It should reflect careful regard for  how we want to evolve as an economy and a society. It should be  based on a thoughtful appraisal of what immigrants can bring to  this process.  The second truth is that our current immigration practice amounts  to letting anyone stay who is lucky, clever or desperate enough to  get in and not get caught for a serious crime. This practice is  neither careful nor thoughtful. Moreover, it contradicts our legal  position, which is never a good strategy. Consequently, an effort  to rationalize our policies is a very good idea.  The White House fact sheet accompanying the speech in which  President Bush proposed his program states its economic rationale:  'Today, President Bush proposed a new temporary worker program to  match willing foreign workers with willing U.S. employers when no  Americans can be found to fill the jobs.' The argument is that we  need immigrants to do jobs that Americans don't want.  This is the falsehood. Or, at least, it's incomplete to the point  of deception. If Americans don't want these jobs, it's usually  because these jobs offer wages and conditions that are unattractive  to them.  \",\n",

But though his arrest was based on bureaucratic errors buried for years in immigration files, it was not exactly a mistake. Professor Bogudlov, 65, a permanent resident of the United States who has visited Moscow 10 times in the last eight years, has become one of 400,000 aliens caught up in a new Homeland Security program to track people with old deportation orders against them.  The crackdown began in 2002 against immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries and last June turned to those convicted of crimes, but in recent months it has shifted to those from any country who have violated civilian immigration rules. Many of those immigrants, like Professor Bogudlov, have no idea there was an order of removal against them, because two-thirds of such orders were issued in absentia when the immigrant failed to show up for a hearing, according to the government's own study of the issue.  In some cases, the immigrant deliberately fled. But years of backlog, wrong addresses and other faulty data so plague old Immigration and Naturalization Service files, the 2002 Department of Justice study found, that the agency had a chronic problem notifying immigrants of hearings and of removal orders.  \",\n",

Officials and immigrant advocates predicted that the bills would be voted down in committee.

Such an environment could make immigrants wary of law enforcement and health care agencies, endangering all state residents in the process, they said.  \"These bills are mean-spirited and misguided,\" Duncan said at a news conference before two House committee hearings on some of the measures. \"[They] will destroy that cooperative spirit and sense of trust we have worked so hard to create.\"  Duncan was joined by more than a dozen speakers, including state delegates, immigration lawyers, advocates for battered women, labor leaders and a Guatemalan who recently served with the U.S. Army in Iraq.

Most of the anti-immigration sentiment in Atlanta is aimed at Mexicans.  Considering that before 1848 Texas, California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona and parts of New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming belonged to Mexico, we should be more sensitive to the fact that borders are artificial, political and temporary divisions. Crossing a border without permission so that you can work hard and make an honest living can hardly be compared to bank robbery.  Most of us are fortunate in that our parents, grandparents, etc. were able to come to the United States when there were few or no restrictions.

The plan, which now goes to the upper house, where it is expected to pass, underscores the growing anti-immigrant feeling in a country that has long been proud of its open, liberal society.  The 83-to-57 vote came after the center-right coalition government rejected demands by opposition parties for greater lenience.  Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk argued that the plan approved Tuesday was humane because it would not break up families, would provide airline tickets and money to returnees, and would still grant amnesty to about 2,300 people facing severe difficulties.  But in recent days, church and human rights groups have held street protests, calling the plan cruel because many of those on the deportation list have lived here for five years or more and had children while awaiting residence papers. Refugee groups have called for hunger strikes and some churches and families have said they will shelter people facing expulsion.  The bill applies to people who arrived in the Netherlands before April 2001. The largest numbers are from the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Proponents say that many of those people can now safely return home, that not all are political refugees, and include ''benefit shoppers.''

Issuing the mandate Thursday, U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle called the government\\'s treatment of asylum-holders \"nothing short of a national embarrassment.\"  The order stemmed from a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of 150,000 asylum-holders by the American Immigration Law Foundation of Washington.

She said the lawsuit was filed in Minnesota partly because of its large immigrant population.  Wettstein said that the ruling also meant a shorter wait for the 130,000 other residency applicants covered by the suit but that it would still take 12 to 13 years to clear the backlog for permanent-resident status unless Congress changed the law.  A Justice Department spokesman in Washington said the agency had not seen the decision and would have to review it before deciding how to proceed.

This has enormous consequences on the domestic economies of third-world nations.  In Mexico, the price of corn has dropped 70 percent while production costs have risen. Mexico, where corn occupies half of the total land used for growing crops, has lost most of its farms over the last 10 years, bringing havoc to the rural economy, forcing mass migration to the cities, bringing ruin and unemployment. And it has spurred the mass migration of campesinos to El Norte.  In small town and large, in every community across America these economic refugees from American corporate greed stand on street corners to try to get a day's pay doing work that no one else will do. They are resented in many communities. People see the downsizing, the unemployment, the foreclosures, the homelessness and bankruptcy as not so very far from them and blame these immigrants.  This is the social and economic context of Farmingville, a community of ordinary middle class and working Americans reeling from the larger forces of international trade rigged to the advantage of the privileged and the wealthy.

The raids Thursday and Friday in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Delaware, Colorado and Pennsylvania capped a yearlong investigation of the Fukienese Flying Dragons gang. Authorities described the gang as a violent criminal enterprise made up mostly of young men from the Chinese province of Fujian, also known as Fukien.  Sixty-four who are alleged to be gang leaders and members were charged with a range of violent crimes in eight federal indictments, which were unsealed in Manhattan federal court Friday. So far, 35 have been arrested, and others are being sought, officials said.  \"This violent gang was responsible for hundreds of kidnappings, robberies, acts of extortion, and smuggling hundreds of illegal aliens into the United States,\" Attorney General Janet Reno said.  U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White of the Southern District of New York said the gang, \"a large and violent spinoff\" from the traditional Flying Dragons organization, has been \"the dominant force in Chinatown since 1990\" and is the only remaining large-scale criminal enterprise there.  With the latest actions against it and other expected arrests, White said, \"we believe we will break the back of the Fukienese Flying Dragons and that we are finally on the verge of freeing Chinatown from the . . . violence and lawlessness that have plagued it for decades.\"  ',\n",

Luis Moreno was born in the Dominican Republic but he lived in the Bronx for more than half his life and he died Jan. 30 after being shot while guarding a gas station in Iraq. Now, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is asking that he be granted citizenship in the United States.  In a letter dated Wednesday, Mayor Bloomberg asked President Bush to grant citizenship posthumously to the 19-year old private, citing a 2002 rule that expedited naturalization for soldiers.  Private Moreno was shot in Baghdad on Jan. 23 and died last week at a hospital in the United Kingdom. He immigrated to the UnitedStates in 1991, but neither he nor members of his family had received citizenship.  About 37,000 immigrants serve in the armed forces, or about 3 percent of the active-duty population, Pentagon officials say. In 2002, President Bush waived the waiting period to apply for citizenship for immigrants who joined the military after Sept. 11. Prior to the waiver, immigrant soldiers were allowed to apply after three years of service.  Relatives, friends and well-wishers streamed into the Ortiz Funeral Home in Washington Heights yesterday, paying their final respects at a wake. Among them was Representative Jose E.

That led to setting up a community advisory council to help bridge the cultural gaps that could hinder foreign-born residents who have HIV/AIDS from seeking help.  Refugees and immigrants who live in Georgia are \"of different ethnic groups, speak different languages and have difference experiences and backgrounds,\" said Clark. \"Whenever people migrate, they migrate with their beliefs, with their understandings and their customs.\"  And sometimes those beliefs and customs --- and fear --- create barriers to getting medical treatment.

The woman had been cooperating with the police against the owners of a Flushing bar that she said had held her captive in a case of human trafficking, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said yesterday. The woman said they beat her and tried to coerce her to become a prostitute to pay back an ever-growing debt.  The immigration agent, Nisim Yushuvayev, was legitimate. But his threats were not, the prosecutors said in an obstruction-of-justice complaint they filed against him yesterday. They said he was in league with the bar owners to spirit the woman out of the country to keep her from providing prosecutors with more information against him.  The story of the agent and the young South Korean woman provided a glimpse of the shadowy world of forced labor and what the prosecutors described as sex slavery in New York City. The prosecutors said the bar owners, Wun and Kyongja Kang, used promises of a better life in the United States to entice two young women from Seoul to work at the bar, the Renaissance Bar & Room Cafe in Flushing.  Before one of the women slipped away and went to the police, the prosecutors said, the gentle promises made in Seoul ended with violence, sexual assaults and efforts to sell the women to a Chinatown brothel. The Kangs were arrested last month. They face federal forced labor charges and have been held without bail. They have pleaded not guilty.  ',\n",

Detractors call him a vigilante, a tag he angrily rejects.  Simcox embodies one of many sides in a complex debate with much at stake not just for border states, but for the country. Illegal immigration divides communities and politicians, and this year the volatile issue is further inflamed by presidential politics.  In Arizona and New Mexico, among the seven states that hold presidential contests tomorrow, controlling immigration is a top election-year priority, along with the economy and the war in Iraq.

However illegal immigrants, called undocumented workers by Mr. Ramirez, should not be allowed to have amnesty or become citizens. These people have knowingly broken the law by entering and staying in this country. Illegal immigrants take away thousands of entry-level jobs that could otherwise go to unemployed American citizens.

Those students -- mostly children of immigrants, especially Hmong refugees -- had watched family members struggle to memorize the test\\'s array of 100 questions. And they wondered: Isn\\'t there a better way to measure citizenship?  So starting in 1998, the students worked to find one. They proposed changes, then advocated their ideas in Minnesota, and even flew to Washington in 2001 to meet members of Congress and immigration officials.  \"We had hands-on experience with the test, and we saw a lot of the flaws with it,\" said Nick Longo, the group\\'s instructor. \"We thought the test should be different, it should be based not only on what you know, but what you do -- on the practice of citizenship, and not just on facts and figures.\"  The students pushed the project for nearly four years, until they finally scattered to different schools in 2002. Then this month, President Bush picked up the theme as he unveiled his immigration reform plan.  \"My administration will examine the standard of knowledge in the current citizenship test,\" Bush announced Jan. 7. \"We must ensure that new citizens know not only the facts of our history, but the ideals that have shaped our history.\"  ',\n",

Portions of a 92-count indictment detailing the alleged scheme were unsealed in El Paso.  Federal agents have spent more than three years investigating the smuggling operation, which they said sought to bring 5 million packs of bootleg cigarettes into the country. Authorities seized 2.5 million packs, estimated to be worth $20 million.  The indictment alleges that Jorge Abraham, 34, of Sunland Park, N.M., masterminded the plot.

This United Nations-like gathering took place Friday at the appropriately named International Institute of Minnesota, a short soccer-ball kick from the State Fairgrounds -- the annual host to the so-called Great Minnesota Get-Together.  The faces on this day belonged to immigrants, legislative aides, representatives from various social service agencies and nonprofits, and a handful of federal immigration officials.

       " 'IMM-15201  PRIMARY  ECONOMIC VIEW; Time to Slaythe Inequality Myth? Not So Fast  IF there is one thing that most people think they know about incomes in the United States over the last few decades, it is probably that salaries have grown more unequal. The rich have gotten richer faster than everyone else has.  In recent weeks, a new book has challenged this conventional wisdom, calling it a statistical mirage, and its striking claim has begun to receive national attention. Among native-born Americans, lower- and middle-income families have actually received proportionately bigger raises than the wealthy, according to \"The Progress Paradox\" (Random House), written by Gregg Easterbrook, a Washington journalist. Only a great influx of immigrants - many of them poor, but richer than they were in their home countries - has made inequality appear to widen in the statistics, Mr. Easterbrook says.  \"Factor out immigration,\" he writes, \"and the rise in American inequality disappears.\"  The idea has echoed from the book into the pages of The Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Times of London and BusinessWeek magazine, among other publications. It seems like one of those facts that could rewrite conventional wisdom about the American economy.  It happens, however, not to be true.  The millions of immigrants who have entered the country in recent decades have indeed made inequality look larger than it otherwise would. But even among households headed by native-born Americans, the rich have done far better than others over the past 20 years - as well as over the past 30, 40 or 50 years, according to government statistics and the economists who study them.

The drug routes, he said, have formed part of the infrastructure for the terrorist networks; their wheels are greased by drugs, which have become \"the international underground currency.\"  \"It\\'s disposable; it\\'s portable; it doesn\\'t give you the headaches that a bundle of cash does because you don\\'t have all the problems of getting it into the banking system and hiding it,\" Mr. Hutchinson said. \"So there\\'s this huge circle now and it all comes back to drugs.\"  Expanding the \"Traffic\" metaphor to encompass immigration and terrorism was not necessarily what USA executives had in mind when they approached Mr. Hutchinson two years ago about revisiting the subject. \"What I basically said to them was that I didn\\'t think audiences would want a retread of the same tale,\" recalled Mr. Hutchinson, who is also the executive producer of the mini-series. \"There\\'s this whole underground economy that\\'s come along in the last 10 years or so since the original \\'Traffik\\' and it\\'s not just about drugs anymore.\"  ',\n",

Satie plays 10 different people, seven women and three men, in this 90-minute solo performance.  \"Refugees\" is less a portrait of each individual in Satie\\'s classroom than an investigation of the impact they had on her in understanding her own family history.  As an assimilated American whose grandparents also immigrated, the character Stephanie (a version of herself) begins to question the gaps, silences and shame in her family\\'s denial of their refugee status.  The play is structured scene by scene as a series of classes, with students telling stories of their lives in broken English and gradually interacting with each other as the play progresses.  Satie\\'s Eastern European accents are the strongest, but the distinction between characters often relies on the reiteration of their names in the script or distinctive repetition of gestures or postures associated with each one.

The proposal is a reaction to President Bush's plan, announced  earlier this month, to legalize as many as 8 million immigrants who  live and work in this country illegally.  'This will increase the number of illegal aliens dramatically, and  (this proposed amendment), at least in Colorado, creates a buffer  and we don't become California,' Tancredo said.

The estimated 51.7 million young people studying in public and private elementary and secondary schools this fall will bring further stress to districts coping with tight budgets. They will have to build schools, use more portable classrooms, buy more books and schedule extra lunch periods.  This anticipated autumn enrollment will eclipse the 51.3 million baby boomers who were in class in 1971. And U.S. school enrollment is expected to keep climbing - to 55.9 million by 2005.  \"It\\'s a rather dramatic increase in enrollment that we see coming. Some of it is immigration. Some of it is the baby boom echo - the children of baby boomers,\" Education Secretary Richard Riley said Thursday.

That second generation of baby boomers is now moving through high school. However, elementary schools have continued to feel enrollment pressure because the number of births in America, bolstered by immigration, has remained steady during the past four or five years, Snyder said.  To meet the need for space, school districts are building schools and additions or making do with portable classrooms while keeping a close eye on teacher-student ratio requirements in their states. Some districts are shifting students by drawing new boundaries. Others are experimenting with holding school year-round.  ',\n",

President Bush alluded to the effort in his speech last week on immigration reform, and this week the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services convened a two-day conference of more than 100 immigrant advocates and academics in Washington to discuss the principles for change and its implications.  The current test has long been criticized as a random collection of unrelated details that conveys little of the significance of citizenship. But efforts to change it elicit concern from immigrant advocates, who fear a new test could become a barrier to citizenship.  \"I don\\'t want to make the test harder, and I don\\'t want to make it easier -- I want to make it more meaningful,\" said Eduardo Aguirre, director of the citizenship agency, one of three new Homeland Security divisions that were part of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Aguirre said he also wants to move toward a more standardized test. The current test is an oral exam in which an examiner picks 10 or so civics questions from a list of 100 included in a study guide.

These immigrants aren\\'t interested in enriching American society, but rather taking what they can from it.  When my parents came to America, they did so because they wanted to share in its promise. They came here with the thought of learning English and assimilating into our culture. Integration was a privilege. That is no longer the case.

Two men were charged with drug trafficking by Jupiter police after being detained by patrolman Nathan Baird, who spotted the party walking along State Road A1A.  Joaquin Pina, 52, of the Dominican Republic, had 2.2 pounds of cocaine inside his shirt, and Amaury Sanchez-Navarro, 30, of Cuba, had about 4 pounds of marijuana in a backpack, police said.  Pina, Sanchez and 10 others arrested by the border patrol were taken to the Palm Beach County Jail.  The others - including a woman from Trinidad, a woman from Haiti, one man each from Haiti and Guyana and five Jamaican men - await a decision on whether they will be held in the county jail as material witnesses in a smuggling case or taken to Krome Detention Center in Miami, Border Patrol spokesman Art Bullock said.  The alleged smuggler, a Bahamian man whose identity was withheld, will be charged with smuggling undocumented foreign nationals. He has a previous conviction for that crime, Bullock said.

Meeting at the start of a two-day Summit of the Americas, the two leaders agreed to put aside past differences and work together on more open borders and expanded trade. But other tensions remained as 34 leaders from throughout the Western Hemisphere gathered in northern Mexico to look for ways to promote democracy and economic development in the region.  Leaders from Brazil and Venezuela said they would try to slow Bush\\'s push for a free-trade agreement linking the entire hemisphere. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, under pressure from the White House to cut his ties to Cuba\\'s Fidel Castro, arrived in a defiant mood.  Before leaving Caracas, Chavez said he would use the summit to \"tell the world\" that Venezuelans would not tolerate what he called U.S. interference in his country\\'s affairs. Canada and the United States have joined forces to try to block Chavez\\'s push for a new humanitarian aid fund for Latin America.  Fox, whose opposition to the invasion strained relations with Bush, offered his congratulations for the capture of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The Mexican president also gave his strongest endorsement yet for Bush\\'s immigration proposal.  The plan, which falls far short of Fox\\'s goal of an open border, would let as many as 8 million illegal workers become legal by joining a new temporary worker program. Although the plan is not limited to Mexico, the vast majority of illegal workers in the United States came from Mexico.  ',\n",

None of the more than 700 illegal immigrants was charged as a terrorist, and the Justice Department\\'s inspector general concluded last year that the government had trampled on a law stipulating that such detentions be limited to 90 days.  The high court turned down a request to review the secrecy surrounding the detainees, nearly all Arabs or Muslims, who were picked up in the United States after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Most were eventually deported for immigration violations. The government refused to disclose whom it held and why.  The court\\'s action, taken without comment, was a victory for President George W. Bush\\'s administration. Civil liberties and media organizations had sought access to the names and other basic information about the detainees.  A federal appeals court had sided with the administration and its argument that knowing the names or details of the arrests would give terrorists a window on the post-Sept. 11 terrorism investigation. By refusing to hear the case, the Supreme Court allowed that ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to stand.  \"Until some other court says otherwise, the government can continue the policy of secret arrests that seems fundamentally inconsistent with basic American values and that we know in this case led to a series of abuses,\" said Steven Shapiro, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which had urged the court to hear the case.

But just talking about wanting migration reform --- no matter if it passes Congress this year --- is a political plus for Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico, who meet here today as the Special Summit of the Americas opens.  Their bilateral meeting gives Bush a chance to try to boost popularity among Hispanic voters at home as the 2000 election season heats up. The 34-nation summit also gives Bush a chance to polish his image in Latin America, where his administration is widely viewed as negligent or arrogant.  Some Latin American leaders were reportedly upset Sunday that the Bush administration wants to steer the two-day summit toward discussion of trade and corruption rather than poverty and development, as originally planned.  \"The encounter in Monterrey could be an opportunity for both Bush and Fox to score points with their respective political constituencies,\" said Armand Peschard-Sverdrup, a Mexico expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Fox\\'s meeting with Bush offers him an opportunity to show that his campaign promise to help migrant workers obtain more U.S. visas might come true before his presidency ends in December 2006.  Last Wednesday, Bush proposed a program that would hand out temporary three-year work permits to millions of undocumented workers in the United States, most of them thought to be Mexican or Central American. The plan puts pressure on Congress, which has several guest-worker proposals pending, to debate reforms during a sensitive electoral season.  ',\n",

The program would bestow temporary legal status for at least six years on the 8 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, as long as they keep their jobs. But it would not automatically put them on a path to obtaining citizenship or even permanent resident status.  What Bush calls his \"temporary worker\" program was embraced by business groups but condemned as stingy and impractical by advocates for immigrants. The administration hopes the plan will appeal to Hispanic voters and expand the Republican political base, and strategists in both parties described it as politically shrewd. But many said it has little chance of passing Congress in the form Bush described.  Bush\\'s program would also allow an unlimited number of new immigrants to enter as long as they obtain jobs through a database that would be run by the government and would offer the openings first to U.S. citizens.  --  Mike Allen  Silicone gel breast implants will not be allowed back on the market for general use because they have not been proved safe over the long term, the federal government said.

That person is the illegal immigrant. Let's call him Sam. This whole immigration debate is about him, the choices he faces and the way he responds.  One thing we know about Sam: he will get here. Between 1986 and 1998, Congress increased the Border Patrol's budget sixfold. Over that time the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. doubled, to eight million. Getting across that border is Sam's shot at a decent future. Maybe his whole family depends upon him. He will not be herded away like a lamb.  At the moment, Sam lives in the shadows of society. But this week, President Bush proposed an immigration reform plan that would offer him a new set of choices.  Under the Bush plan, Sam could become a visible member of society with legal documentation. He could get a driver's license. He could benefit from worker protection laws, and possibly see his wages rise. He could open a bank account, which would let him ship money back home without having to pay huge fees.

Workers and employers alike were desperate to know: How could they sign up?  \"There is no program. I explain to everyone we could wait a year or more to get legislation,\" said Lurie, part of the immigration law firm of Greenberg Traurig in McLean.

Federal lawmakers \"have to write legislation based upon this rather amorphous plan,\" said Michael Maggio, an immigration lawyer in the District. \"Nothing\\'s really totally clear on this.\"  The proposal Bush announced Wednesday would allow many of the estimated 8 million illegal immigrants in the United States to apply for \"temporary worker\" visas, which would be good for three years and could be renewed.

       " 'IMM-1534  PRIMARY  CRITERIA SHOULD FOCUS ON IMMIGRANTS\\' SKILLS  THE United States has a vital interest in ending illegal immigration and reforming legal immigration to serve the interests of families, workers and taxpayers. Legislation I\\'ve introduced, the Immigration in the National Interest Act, would do that.  The legal immigration system is broken. Family unification is supposed to be the core of legal immigration. However, more than 1 million husbands, wives and minor children of U.S. permanent residents wait years for permission to join their immediate families. In the meantime, we continue to admit more than 120,000 adult brothers, sisters and children.  Furthermore, these adult immigrant categories are themselves heavily backlogged, with waits for admission from five to 40 years. The backlogs encourage illegal immigration.  The bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, criticized these inequities. \"Unless there is a compelling interest to do otherwise, immigrants should be chosen on the basis of the skills they contribute to the U.S. economy. While the admission of nuclear families and refugees provide such a compelling national interest, reunification of adult children and siblings of adult citizens do not reach that level,\"\\' the commission said.  As the commission recognized, immigration should meet the needs of the American economy. Yet, more than 75 percent of recent immigration is by persons who have met no criteria based on education, job skills or even literacy.  My bill would result in admission for all immediate family members of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. The percentage of immigrants admitted on the basis of skills and education will increase. Sponsors of immigrants will be held responsible to ensure that new arrivals do not become dependent on public benefits. Legal immigration will remain at historically high levels: an average of about 700,000 a year.  ',\n",

The suspension did not appear to immediately threaten the immigration agreement between the countries, which sets the rules for the arrival of more than 20,000 Cuban immigrants to the United States every year, as well as for hundreds of political refugees.  But the administration\\'s move appeared to signal a further hardening of relations with Cuba by effectively shutting down one of its few avenues for regular communication with the Marxist government. The United States cut off diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba in the early 1960\\'s.  Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the United States had repeatedly sought in recent years to address issues related to exit visas, monitoring of dissidents and other matters, only to be rebuffed by Cuban officials.  \"We have told Cuba that we\\'re ready to go to talks when they\\'re ready to discuss the serious issues that need to be discussed,\" Mr. Boucher said.  The talks have been a fixture of United States-Cuban relations since accords in 1994 and 1995 brought an end to an exodus of Cuban trying to reach South Florida on rafts and other small craft. The administration is insisting on discussing five issues: Cuban delays in issuing exit permits to American-approved migrants; cooperation in staging a new lottery for visa seekers; access to a deeper Cuban port so large Coast Guard cutters can repatriate illegal migrants; obstacles placed in the path of American officials seeking to monitor the fate of returned migrants and others affected by mass arrests of dissidents last spring; and Cuba\\'s refusal to accept the return of migrants who have committed crimes in this country and are, in immigration parlance, excludable.

And the Bureau of Prisons, criticized for the treatment of illegal immigrants in Brooklyn after the Sept. 11 attacks, agreed to hold on to prison videotapes for six months to help investigate accusations of physical and verbal abuse against its guards. An investigation into reports that Brooklyn prisoners were physically and verbally abused was stymied for a time by the disappearance of the prison's videotapes.  The report, by Glenn A. Fine, the inspector general for the Justice Department, grew out of a major investigation that his office completed last year into the treatment of hundreds of illegal immigrants arrested on immigration violations after the Sept. 11 attacks. That investigation concluded that the Justice Department had allowed many illegal immigrants with no connection to terrorism to languish in federal prisons for weeks or sometimes months in unduly harsh conditions.

Reforming immigration laws could serve national security and economic interests, said Jorge Saavedra, chief legal officer of Centro Legal in St. Paul, which provides legal services to needy Hispanics.  \"The solutions, because they are so politically controversial, maybe are not easy, but it\\'s important we get this back on the public policy agenda for debate,\" Saavedra said.  The value of undocumented labor in six Minnesota industries, including construction, meat processing and hotels, was estimated at $1.56 billion in a study released in September 2000 by Minneapolis-based nonprofit Hispanic Advocacy and Community Empowerment Through Research.  James Kielkopf, who wrote the HACER study, said that while the number of undocumented workers had continued growing since the study came out, the value of their labor likely had not changed because of the economic slowdown.  Minnesota had one of the country\\'s fastest-growing Latino populations in the 1990s, rising 166 percent to 143,000. The total was estimated at 159,000 in July 2002, according to census figures. People of Mexican origin accounted for two-thirds of Minnesota\\'s Latinos.  ',\n",

The state will stop paying for the hospital stays of these poor  legal residents. It has also slashed reimbursement to doctors from  82 percent of the Medicaid rate to 50 percent. The state Medical  Services Board voted Dec. 12 to cut the Old Age Pension Health and  Medical Care Fund because the program would exceed its budget by  $ 2.5 million.  Earlier last year, Gov. Bill Owens signed a bill that revoked  Medicaid coverage for some legal immigrants. The American Civil  Liberties Union challenged the law in federal court on  equal-protection grounds. After a federal district judge threw out  the lawsuit, it was appealed to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate court stayed implementation.  Most of the 4,289 people receiving the $ 589-a-month state old-age  benefits are legal immigrants, including Russian-Jewish refugees,  Vietnamese and Hispanics. The constitutionally authorized plan  dates from Depression days and provides $ 10 million a year for the  care of the elderly poor - over 60 but younger than 65, the minimum  age for Medicare.

The State Department granted the last remaining group of Indochinese refugees -- 15,000 Hmong villagers living in Thailand -- permission to immigrate. Many will end up in the Central Valley, one of two Hmong enclaves in America.  The decision, while compassionate, was long overdue, and marked a turnaround in administration policy. It would be even better if the decision signaled a loosening of restrictions that have slowed the admission of refugees to America to a trickle since Sept.11.  The Hmong lived in isolated mountainous regions of Laos. They were recruited as America\\'s allies during the \"secret war\" there, in which they rescued U.S. pilots and harassed North Vietnamese troops using the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos. They became war victims after the United States abandoned Vietnam -- and them -- in 1975.  Fearing reprisals by the North Vietnamese puppet government in Laos, several hundred thousand fled to refugee camps in Thailand. Many were admitted to the United States, France and Australia, but others stayed and continued a guerrilla war against the Pathet Lao. After the United Nations closed the camps a decade ago, 15,000 fled to a Buddhist monastery, where they have remained.  The United States had taken the view that the Hmong were free to return home to Laos, but the Hmong, citing strong evidence of persecution, refused to budge. The State Department relented after the Thai government threatened to evict them.  ',\n",

Homeland Security officials say the system - called the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program, or US-VISIT - will record the comings and going of some 24 million people a year.  Officials insist the new system will add only 10 to 15 seconds to the time it takes immigration agents to interview a person entering the U.S., while improving the virtually untracked visa system and making the nation safer.  But critics say it will do little to intercept would-be terrorists and may further antagonize allies who are already balking at a growing tangle of red tape for their citizens to visit the U.S.  \"The system seems to presume that most terrorists are fools,\" said Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., think tank on defense and terrorism.  Critics note the program has a giant loophole because it doesn\\'t apply to citizens of 28 countries where a U.S. visa is not needed for entry - mostly Western European states, plus Canada, Australia and Japan.  \"Many of the countries that we consider our closest allies harbor Al Qaeda sympathizers,\" Thompson said. \"As a consequence, the simple possession of nationality in those friendly countries is no guarantee of friendly intent.\"  ',\n",

On a recent Sunday at about 3 a.m., a Gwinnett County police chase ended in a crash in my front yard approximately 25 feet from my daughter's bed.  My experience leads me to believe the driver was drunk and had no driver's license, no insurance and no green card. Gwinnett police confirmed that he had a long list of criminal activity.  Twice we have lost cars in our family from being hit by illegals. One was drunk and ran away. He even left his vehicle, which was permanently attached to my daughter's, from the head-on collision. Did they catch him? Of course not. Who pays for this? Our insurance . . . and the rest from our pocket.  While it is not a priority to the federal government, and obviously not to Sue Brown, I want to make it known that there are many good, decent, hardworking families who live among these illegal aliens and are held hostage and terrorized every single day. We live in fear of drive-by shootings (one of which happened on my street in January 2001 just after we entered our home).

One was arrested three times previously --- in 2002 on a concealed weapons charge and twice in 2003 for breaking into cars --- without anyone checking his legal status.  That\\'s not unusual.  Determining the legal status of an arrested person isn\\'t a practice that local law enforcement officials engage in, said Cpl. Dan Huggins, spokesman for the Gwinnett Police Department.  Immigration laws are federal laws, he said, and local police don\\'t charge county residents with violating federal laws.  \"We don\\'t charge people for the crime of being illegal,\" Huggins said. \"That\\'s just not something we do.\"  That activity falls under the purview of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, he said. The agency handles questions of documentation and residency for local officials.  In the case of the eight home-invasion suspects, an immigration official saw an article about the arrests in the newspaper and contacted Gwinnett County, said Sue Brown, the spokeswoman for the Atlanta office of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.

Now, a detailed study has concluded those payments add up to more than a billion dollars a year that goes to Latin America from workers in the District, Maryland and Virginia.  The massive flows are part of an estimated $30 billion annually that Latin American immigrants in the United States convey to their home countries, according to the study, to be released today by the Inter-American Development Bank.  Of that amount, the study estimates, $94 million comes from the District. Immigrants living in Maryland send $500 million, the survey estimates, and those living in Virginia send $586 million. Most Latino immigrants in Maryland and Virginia live in the Washington suburbs. The study said the region\\'s immigrants are more likely to send money to Latin American than are immigrants nationwide, and they send money more often.  \"It adds up very quickly. If you can imagine $30 billion going south every year, from people who are maids and parking attendants and day laborers, it\\'s a pretty amazing phenomenon,\" said Sergio Bendixen, whose Florida-based polling firm was commissioned to do the study.  While sending money home is an age-old immigrant tradition, the flows are receiving increasing attention from development experts.

After a two-week jury trial in United States Court for the Southern District of New York, the man, Mustafa Ozsusamlar, 60, was found guilty of bribing a public official -- a window clerk at a Washington motor vehicles office -- and of transporting illegal immigrants by van from New York City to Washington, where he provided them, for a fee, with false licenses.  Mr. Ozsusamlar made at least 70 trips to Washington from the New York area as part of the operation, officials said, and charged $1,500 to $2,000 in cash for the trip and a license. Most of the immigrants were of Middle Eastern, Russian or Southern Asian descent. It was unclear yesterday what if any penalties or charges they face.

The White House noted that thousands of employers could be affected by the ban, but it is unlikely that many will fall prey to it.

At the same time, Attorney General John Ashcroft is now considering a particularly poignant appeal for asylum by a woman from Guatemala. Mr. Ashcroft should grant her request and then support the adoption of the new, enlightened guidelines for helping other abused women seeking asylum in America.  This is not about eroding well-established asylum policies, or creating some flimsy loophole that will open the floodgates to immigrants who simply seek a better life. As the Taliban nightmare in Afghanistan so powerfully illustrated, women in some societies are systematically oppressed as an ideological matter. They deserve the protections international law affords other persecuted exiles.  Asylum is granted for exiles in danger of persecution back home because of their race, religion, ethnicity or political associations, or for being in a particular social group. It is that last category that should cover people like the woman from Guatemala, Rodi Alvarado Pena, who fled to this country after a decade of abuse and whose case is now before the attorney general.

But in a program being tested in Atlanta and Denver, bureau officials detain them when they walk out of the courtroom. They are held in county facilities that have a contract with the federal government.  Federal officials say the new policy, announced at the end of March, is an effort to cut down on absconders, those who \"go underground\" after they are ordered to leave the country.

But in a presidential campaign in which partisan lines have been sharply  drawn over welfare and the budget, the subject of immigration has yet to  provoke muchof a stir. With the notable exception of Pat Buchanan, for  instance, the major Republican challengers have been content to voice  approving soundbites about legal immigration, while uniformly condemning  illegal entry.  A year after inspiring the Proposition 187 movement in California to deny public services to undocumented aliens, though, illegal immigration is less  and less the issue, at least in presidential politics. Everyone is against it,  even many of the most ardent defenders of immigration, leaving little room for argument.  It may simply be too early. The campaign, after all, has yet to move full  force into the states where immigration really matters, like California and  Florida.  There may be a deeper reason, though: When it comes to immigration, there  is no simple liberal-conservative divide. It's a Democratic president, Bill  Clinton, who can lay claim to actually cracking down on illegals, and who has  endorsed a proposal to reduce the levels of legal immigration by as much as a  third.  Only Buchanan has gone further. He calls for a five-year moratorium on most legal immigration, while other Republican candidates, including Sens.

The Inn at Mystic, in Mystic, Conn., is short 16 seasonal employees because of a ceiling on a visa program that allows foreign nationals with various skills to work in the United States for nine months.  \"We\\'ll be open but we won\\'t be to full capacity,\" Dyer said.  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services cut off applications for this temporary visa program, the H-2B visa, on March 9 when the agency knew it would meet its annual limit of 66,000 foreign workers. With demand for workers surging -- the government already received more than 100,000 applications -- it was the first time the agency turned away applicants before the end of a fiscal year.  Now businesses from hotels in Rhode Island to the fishing industry in Alaska are short-handed and struggling to fill temporary jobs that local workers don\\'t want.  Pennie Beach, co-owner of the Basin Harbor Club in Vergennes, Vt., said she\\'s missing \"a crucial core\" of her 65 housekeepers and food service workers.  Employers usually turn to the H-2B program as a last resort; they must first recruit within the United States before they can turn to foreign workers. Foreign workers are paid the same wages Americans would be paid.  ',\n",
       " \"IMM-15647  PRIMARY  Suburbs catering to newcomers  For many years, immigrants to the U.S. have flocked to large  cities. Now a new trend has emerged: They are moving in even  greater numbers to the suburbs.  Analysis of Census 2000 figures by the Brookings Institution showed  a 178 percent increase in new Americans coming to the Denver area  in the 1990s. The size of that increase surprised many. Even more  surprising was that during that decade, 40,000 more foreign-born  people moved to the suburbs than to Denver itself.  Leaders in suburban communities recognize that the newcomers are  here to stay, so they are working to bring those newcomers more  fully into the life of their communities. For example, 70 Littleton  citizens recently attended a two-day leadership retreat to learn  about the new Americans in their community and to explore ways to  reach out to them.  Littleton saw a 13 percent increase in foreign-born residents from  1980 to 2000. City Manager Jim Woods acknowledged that some may see  an increase in new people as a challenge. Instead, he said, 'Our  City Council and staff choose to see it as an opportunity.  Immigrants bring energy, an entrepreneurial spirit and values of  caring for family and friends.'  Tony Hernandez, director of Fannie Mae's Colorado Partnership  Office, pointed out that immigrants buy homes more quickly than  people born in the U.S. That's partly because immigrants want to be  rooted, he said, and partly because it's impossible for ordinary  people to own a home in many of their native countries.  \",\n",

Continuing a crackdown on the smuggling of illegal immigrants, federal authorities made 26 arrests Tuesday at Newark Liberty International Airport, bringing the total to 158 in less than a week.  The immigrants crossed into Arizona from Mexico, hid in safe houses in Phoenix and Los Angeles, then boarded flights to Newark, said officials with the Department of Homeland Security\\'s Immigration and Customs Enforcement division.  The agency is investigating at least two smuggling rings based in the Southwest but had not charged anyone with immigrant smuggling as of yesterday, spokesman Mike Gilhooly said.  \"Those organizations are responsible for transporting people across the border, charging them thousands of dollars, taking them to safe houses, and then putting them onto planes,\" he said.  He would not identify the groups believed responsible.  In the latest arrests, 20 passengers getting off a Continental Airlines flight from Los Angeles that landed at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday were arrested and charged with being in the country illegally. A person who went to meet the group also was arrested on immigration charges.  Two hours later, three passengers from an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles were arrested, along with two people who had arrived at the airport to meet them. All five were held on immigration charges.

The guidelines, made public Tuesday by Asa Hutchinson, the department's undersecretary for border and transportation security, were welcomed by civil rights groups that had bitterly denounced the detention of 762 immigration violators after the attacks, based on sometimes ill-founded FBI suspicionsthat they had links to terrorism.

Different choices, different outcome.  If she could do it again, she would apply for U.S. citizenship soon after arriving in this country with her American husband. She would talk to him about her money trouble instead of helping herself from the cash register of the Herndon restaurant where she was a waitress. When caught, she would find a private lawyer instead of accepting the services of the Fairfax County public defender. She would ask her attorney how a guilty plea would affect her immigration status.  But at the end of her dreaming and regretting, Mi-Choong O'Brien, 50, remains where she started, at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth, Va. For her crime -- she says she took $70, the restaurant says it was at least $11,000, and her plea agreement states $3,000 -- she was sentenced to three years, all but a month suspended. Now she is being detained under a 1996 immigration law that allows the United States to deport noncitizens with criminal convictions and sentences of a year or more.  For the first several years, nonviolent felons were less likely to be deported because their cases were not fully tracked by computer and enforcement was less aggressive. But since the Department of Homeland Security absorbed the functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service more than a year ago, government officials say they are obligated to pursue those cases, including O'Brien's.  \",\n",

Farouk Abdel-Muhti, who supporters say has been held because of outspoken activism against Israel, especially during appearances on WBAI radio, could be freed within 10 days.  The Daily News detailed Abdel-Muhti\\'s plight in a May 25, 2003, special report that identified the self-described Palestinian freedom fighter as perhaps the last of 1,200 illegal immigrants detained since the 9/11 attacks who had not been charged with a crime, released, deported or classified as a material witness.  U.S. District Judge Yvette Kane said Abdel-Muhti, 56, should be released because the federal government had failed to show there is any likelihood it would deport him in the foreseeable future.  According to federal case law, a detainee should be released when there is no reasonable expectation that he or she will be deported within six months.  In her ruling, released Thursday, Kane noted that the government has been trying to deport Abdel-Muhti for years, but neither the United States or Abdel-Muhti had success getting a country to accept him.  Abdel-Muhti\\'s dilemma played out against several important issues beyond his control: the war on terrorism, the unresolved Middle East peace process, open U.S. borders and the chronic failure of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, now known as the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, to keep track of known illegal aliens long before Sept. 11, 2001.

Yet Mayor Bloomberg - who was elected with the help of one-third of the Hispanic vote - disagrees.  \"The essence of citizenship is the right to vote, and you should go about becoming a citizen before you get the right to vote,\" he said Friday on his weekly radio program.

Bush that would allow illegal immigrants to get behind the wheel legally is too great a security risk. Indeed, several of the 9/11 hijackers had driver licenses. Delray Beach police gave plot leader Mohamed Atta a warning for speeding July 5, 2001. A month earlier, Broward County officials had issued a warrant for Atta for not appearing in court on a charge of driving without a license. The background checks proposed in Senate Bill 1360 might have prevented the terrorists from getting licenses in the first place.  Under the bill sponsored by Sen. Rudy Garcia, R-Hialeah:  * If a foreign national cannot prove his identity with a green card, a U.S.-issued employment authorization card or other acceptable proof, the applicant could present an ID card issued by his country's embassy or consulate. That country cannot be an enemy of the United States.  * Applicants would be fingerprinted.  * Consulates would have to provide criminal background checks on the applicants.  * The licenses would be valid in Florida only and for only two years.  * Applicants would have to prove they own or are leasing a car.  Without a license, many undocumented workers will continue driving untrained and uninsured, putting all on the road at risk.

With 40 People Part of Wide Problem, Officials Say  The discovery of 40 illegal immigrants crammed into a truck approaching the Chesapeake Bay Bridge two days ago has alerted officials here to a problem that immigration authorities say is spreading across the United States: the organized, criminal smuggling of foreigners to provide low-wage labor.  Immigration officials said the Anne Arundel County incident, in which 19 Mexicans and 21 Guatemalans were found in the back of a rental truck that crashed near a tollbooth, was the first time in nearly two years that an immigrant smuggling operation had been uncovered in this area. In April 1994, 63 illegal Chinese immigrants were found being held captive in a Prince George\\'s County house.  \"This far north of the border, we usually discover these things only when there is a traffic accident or violation. But in my opinion, a large percentage of persons illegally employed in this area get here with someone\\'s assistance,\" said Benedict Ferro, director of the Maryland district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Other INS officials said the discovery of the smuggled immigrants also was an indication that with the U.S. government cracking down on border crossings in California and Texas, workers from Mexico and Central America who normally would try to sneak north on their own are turning to long-distance smugglers for help, exposing themselves to physical abuse and extortion.  \"These individuals had been in the back of a van for two days, traveling nonstop from Arizona to the Eastern Shore, under horrific conditions,\" said Russ Bergeron, a national spokesman for the INS. \"The smugglers know they are at risk, so they keep moving without the least concern for the safety and rights of their passengers.

Now, control of that brand is up for grabs. At stake is whether the  premier voice on clean air, water and wild places will embrace a  mission to curtail immigration. If so, the club's credibility on  Capitol Hill and with the public on other issues may be severely  diluted.

The board already has three members promoting an  anti-immigration agenda, and two who frequently ally with them.  None are up for re-election this year. So if the five anti-immigration candidates win, the board's views on immigration  could tilt dramatically.  One anti-immigration candidate, former Colorado Gov. Dick Lamm,  joined the club just weeks before announcing his board candidacy.  For some, that doesn't inspire confidence he has the club's best  interests at heart.  Sensible discussion of immigration reform inevitably should be part  of the Sierra Club's agenda, as elsewhere in American politics,  regardless of the election's outcome. The club's board rejected an  anti-immigration mission in 1996, and the general membership nixed  a similar ballot question in 1998. Now the issue is whether the  club may become focused on deterring immigration to the detriment  of other issues.  For years, the environmental movement has been legitimately  criticized for representing mostly wealthy Caucasians. So, the  Sierra Club has tried to recruit minority members. That push may  falter if the board embraces an agenda some perceive as racist.  \",\n",

The men were rounded up after federal agents launched a review of the 11,000 people registered as convicted sex offenders in Virginia. The agents were looking for those who had committed crimes specifically against children and were not U.S. citizens and therefore eligible for deportation, according to Kevin Delli-Colli, acting special agent in charge of the Washington Immigration and Customs office.  The 12 arrests, along with seven in the Richmond and Tidewater areas, were part of a program called \"Operation Predator.\"  The program culls through sex-offender registries to find possible deportees and has arrested about 2,180 foreign-born child sex offenders nationally since July, said Frank Figueroa, the program\\'s national coordinator.

A couple years ago, after Lydia Dilianczou graduated with a degree in social work, she set out to see the world.  While she was still at the University of Bratislava, in her native Slovakia, she heard about a Florida-based contract-work company that a dvertised widely in Eastern Europe and promised menial jobs in the United States.  Using her savings and graduation gifts, she bought a plane ticket to Florida. She signed an employment contract there and was sent to a St. Louis hotel for a $6.50-an-hour kitchen job. She didn't know English then, but the contractors didn't care.  She traveled on a U.S. tourist visa. No employment is allowed on a tourist visa, and tourists may not stay more than three months at a time. Having grown up in a Communist satellite state where black-market jobs were common, she never imagined that she'd need a lawyer to keep her out of jail.  But last October, she and other contract workers across the country landed in jail and were charged with working on tourist visas.

That was too much for a federal appeals court, which overturned Castrejon\\'s deportation order Friday. The court compared immigration officials to the fictional policeman whose obsessive chase of a petty thief was chronicled in Victor Hugo\\'s \"Les Miserables.\"  The effort to deport Castrejon has been a \"pursuit worthy of Inspector Javert,\" said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  Castrejon, a native of Mexico, entered the United States without documentation in 1970 at age 17 and has never had legal status. However, as a longtime resident with \"good moral character,\" and with a family that would suffer hardship with his deportation, he would be eligible to stay except for the dispute over his eight-day trip, the court said.  An immigration judge made the finding of good character last year despite Castrejon\\'s 1975 conviction for illegally transporting illegal immigrants within the United States. He served six months in jail, and later was jailed for 18 months for violating probation by reentering the country.  He remained in the United States after his release, raised a family and started a business. He now lives in Modesto with his wife and three U.S.-born children and owns a construction company that employs 10 people.  He first went to Mexico in 1983 to seek a visa, which would allow his legal entry into the United States, but was turned down by the U.S. consulate in the mistaken belief that his conviction disqualified him, the court said. He tried again in 1988 but left after eight days when his wife gave birth earlier than expected.  ',\n",

The $10 million plan, to be announced on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security, will include the first use of unmanned aircraft for border patrol, the addition of several hundred agents and the creation of seven tent complexes to detain illegal border crossers.  Asa Hutchinson, an under secretary for domestic security, said in an interview that a tightening of security in border areas in California, Texas and elsewhere had led smugglers to turn in increasing numbers to Arizona -- often with violent results.  ''This is not a secure border,'' Mr. Hutchinson said. ''Arizona has become the chokepoint. This is our current battleground.''  But some human rights and immigrants' advocates believe that broader economic and political changes -- rather than a law enforcement crackdown -- are the answer.  ''Our border is in utter chaos here in Arizona,'' said the Rev. Robin Hoover, head of a Tucson group called Humane Borders that provides relief for migrants, ''but a Berlin Wall is not the way to solve the problem.''  Moreover, the unmanned aircraft face technical and safety hurdles. A report in January by the Congressional Research Service said that drones, as the aircraft are commonly known, offer several attractive features for border patrol work and can identify ''a potentially hostile target the size of a milk carton at an altitude of 60,000 feet.'' But their use is also hindered by accident rates more than 100 times that of manned aircraft, according to the report.  \",\n",

By a vote of 82 to 52, Democrats fought off an attempt to attach an amendment prohibiting recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other states onto a bill that would set fees for marriage licenses. The \"defense of marriage\" proposal was narrowly defeated Friday by the House Judiciary Committee.  When a bill on commercial driver\\'s licenses came up later, Del. Herbert H.

More important, the article puts to rest the myth, often perpetuated by nativist xenophobes, that cheap labor from abroad drives down wages.  Part of the reason immigrants don\\'t depress wages, the Fed argues, is that they often hold down jobs that native-born Americans wouldn\\'t consider doing. Case in point: the Jennie-O Turkey Store plant in Barron, Wis.  \"American kids don\\'t want to take those jobs; they leave for the [Twin] Cities,\" said Zoltan Grossman, a geographer at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire who studied the Somali community in Barron. \"So [Jennie-O] basically would have had to close the plant because of a labor shortage if it wasn\\'t for immigrants.\"  Furthermore, recent studies have shown that immigrants don\\'t displace similarly skilled native-born workers. According to David Card, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, immigration in the late 1980s reduced the relative employment rates of natives in low-skilled occupations by no more than 3 percent, even in major immigrant cities like Miami and Los Angeles.  And when immigrants go head to head with native-born workers in semiskilled assembly jobs, they lose. That\\'s primarily because of their limited work experience and poor command of English. So instead of complaining about immigrant labor, native-born workers should focus on upgrading their job skills, said Bruce Corrie, an economist at Concordia University.  ',\n",

We can't claim we are Americans, because legally we are not. And yet on every form where race is required, the term African-American is all we have to identify ourselves.  We are neither Africans nor Americans, and if our African-American brothers and sisters think they have a problem with identity, they should see what we go through to identify ourselves. Nevertheless, we are glad to be in America.  John Wanda Arlington, Va., Aug. 29, 2004  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-15959  PRIMARY  Immigrant's Search for a Heart Is Frustrating  In an intensive care unit at Bellevue Hospital Center, Isidoro Jimenez drifts in and out of sleep as anguished relatives watch nervously at his bedside. Days earlier, his heart had started beating irregularly for several minutes, to the point where his life was in danger.  ''Quiet. Don't try to talk,'' says his wife, Edelmira Lopez, following with her eyes the intravenous lines that trail his frail body. ''Your heart is still too weak.''  Mr. Jimenez, 47, has been hospitalized on and off for two years. He has congestive heart failure and unless he receives a transplant, doctors say, he will die.  But Mr. Jimenez's journey is more than one of illness and time, more than the story of an illegal immigrant who cannot get a transplant operation because he is not a citizen. His journey is also one of miles: he has traveled from New York City, back to his native Mexico and to New York again -- this time aided by smugglers -- all the while getting sicker, in his search for a new heart.  Until a transplant center agrees to assume responsibility for him, Mr. Jimenez will not be placed on the national waiting list. Misunderstandings, a false rumor of a possible transplant in New York, and distrust have brought him to the brink of death.  Doctors at Bellevue are trying to stabilize Mr. Jimenez with medicine to ease the swelling and the coughing. He breathes through a tube, and an implanted pacemaker helps regulate his heartbeat.  \",\n",

His lawyer decries a ``kangaroo court.\\'\\'  Sajjad Naseer, the 29-year-old Denver man swept up in a federal immigration-fraud investigation of his family, has been deported to Pakistan, officials said Thursday.  Though the criminal case in federal court involves no terrorism charges, it was investigated by Denver\\'s Joint Terrorism Task Force.  Now Naseer is among the first legal U.S. residents to be removed from the country for having attended a terrorist training camp, officials said. Naseer admitted attending such a camp on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in the summer of 2001.  His deportation was made possible by the USA Patriot Act, the federal anti-terrorism legislation passed in the wake of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  \"This is exactly what Congress wanted to do when they passed that law,\" said Donald O\\'Hare, lead attorney on Naseer\\'s case for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security. \"Up until the Patriot Act, someone like Sajjad Naseer ... would have been able to train in that group\\'s camp without any legal liability in the United States.\"  Government officials called Naseer\\'s deportation an important legal victory, but his lawyer, David Lane, considers it \"a travesty,\" he said.  If the Justice Department really thought Naseer was a terrorist, it would have charged him with a terrorism crime in federal court, Lane said.  \"It\\'s absurd to believe they honestly believe he\\'s a terrorist, yet they\\'re turning him loose in Pakistan,\" Lane said. \"That\\'s ludicrous.

The lawsuit, which names Gov. George E. Pataki and the motor vehicles commissioner, Raymond P.

Immigrant advocates have denounced the policy as discriminatory against noncitizens and dangerous to highway safety.  The lawsuit, to be filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is being brought on behalf of all New Yorkers denied a driver's license or identity document for lack of a verifiable Social Security number or an immigration document satisfactory to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Among the seven plaintiffs are a 60-year-old licensed asbestos remover who worked in the World Trade Center cleanup, a teenage refugee from Albania and the Irish father of an American-born infant who needs to be driven to medical treatment for her seizures.  Most are here without legal authorization, the court papers say, but two who are in the United States legally also had their applications denied by motor vehicles clerks without notice or chance for redress, the lawsuit said.  \",\n",
       " \"IMM-15988  PRIMARY  IN THE IMMIGRATION MUD; UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS DO THE JOBS THAT NO ONE WANTS, BOOSTING OUR ECONOMY  As the candidates for president argue about a war today and another war that ended three decades ago, they say next to nothing about illegal immigration and other non-war issues the winner will have to deal with. But hey, who needs them?  Some of us are doing just fine throwing mud.  The latest muck comes from the arch-conservative Center for Immigration Studies. It said the other day that illegal immigrants cost the federal government about $10 billion a year, and that legalizing them would triple the cost.  The only reasonable response to the new study is, so what?  Of course illegal immigrants cost the feds something. Let's take any group of working-poor Americans. Say, minimum-wage restaurant workers without health insurance. Measure how much they soak up in federally supported hospitals, school meals, subsidized housing and other programs. We're talking billions of dollars.  But that wouldn't be fair to them, right? Even though the taxes they pay individually may not cover what they use in public services, the industries they keep alive pay into the federal treasury. Their work has a profound economic value that's hard to measure. Educating their children costs us now, but these kids will be paying for our retirement down the road.  The Center for Immigration Studies might as well have dredged up a similar study from 10 years ago in California. Back then, voters passed a mean-spirited, round-them-up ballot measure that a federal court tossed out one year later. Then as now, simplistic cost studies only serve to feed unrealistic demands for herding farmworkers into Border Patrol vans, militarizing the border and other extreme solutions.  \",\n",
       " 'IMM-15990  PRIMARY  Study: Illegal immigrants a burden; Report contrasts federal taxes paid to services used  A study released Wednesday by a conservative think tank in Washington says illegal immigrants cost the federal government almost $10.4 billion more than they paid in taxes in 2002.  Titled \"The High Cost of Cheap Labor,\" the report by the Center for Immigration Studies used census data to evaluate illegal immigrants\\' use of federal programs vs. the taxes they paid.  It found that illegal immigrant households each use an average of $2,700 a year more in federal services than they pay in taxes, amounting to an overall $26.3 billion in services against $16 billion in taxes.  Among the most-used programs were Medicaid ($2.5 billion); food assistance programs ($1.9 billion); treatment for the uninsured ($2.2 billion); the federal prison and court systems ($1.6 billion); and federal aid to schools ($1.4 billion).  The study says legalizing the immigrants will only increase their costs. It says they will get more federal assistance but will not pay significantly more taxes because they are not likely to get better-paying jobs.  Pro-immigration groups criticized the study, saying it failed to take into account gains in American productivity that resulted from immigrants\\' willingness to take on low-income service jobs, such as the added hours middle-class parents can spend at work because they can hire nannies who are often illegal immigrants.  Frank Sharry, director of the Immigration Forum, a pro-immigration think tank, said the study\\'s timing is political.  ',\n",
       " 'IMM-15998  PRIMARY  Illegal Immigrants\\' Cost To Government Studied  A report that found that illegal immigrants in the United States cost the federal government more than $10 billion a year -- a sum it estimated would almost triple if they were given amnesty -- has drawn criticism from immigration advocacy groups.  For its report, the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that advocates tougher immigration policies, used Census Bureau figures to compare the revenue that illegal immigrants contribute through taxes with the cost of government services they use.  \"Households headed by illegal aliens imposed more than $26.3 billion in costs on the federal government in 2002 and paid only $16 billion in taxes, creating a net fiscal deficit of $10.4 billion, or $2,700 per illegal household,\" said Steven A. Camarota, author of the study.  The costs outlined in the report include government services such as Medicaid, medical treatment for the uninsured, food assistance programs, the federal prison and court systems, and federal aid to schools.  The study acknowledged that, on average, the costs that illegal-immigrant households bear on the federal government are less than half that of other households, and that many of those costs relate to their U.S.-born children. It also pointed out that tax payments by illegal-immigrant households constitute one-fourth those of other households because of low-income jobs.  \"With nearly two-thirds of illegal aliens lacking a high school degree, the primary reason they create a fiscal deficit is their low education levels and resulting low incomes and tax payments, not their legal status or heavy use of most social services,\" Camarota said.

In the Chinese city of Wenzhou there is a hospital with the lyrical name of East Wind. Hu Shuyue and Chun Nan remember it well.  Hu was strapped to an operating table there for a forced abortion when she was six months pregnant with her third child; Chun Nan was ordered to East Wind to be sterilized after the birth of her second son.  \"I will never forget that,\" said Hu, 40, wincing at the memory. \"I am so sad, so bitter.\"  Both women fled China by paying Chinese gangsters to smuggle them into the United States aboard the Golden Venture cargo ship, which ran aground near New York City in June 1993 with nearly 300 passengers.  The women sought political asylum in America, saying they were fleeing the harsh birth control policies of China.  But that has not been enough to satisfy immigration officials and, now, after two years of detention, Hu and Chun Nan are on the verge of being sent back to an uncertain fate in China.  The likely deportation of Hu, Chun Nan and other Chinese women is threatening to raise a fresh political storm for the Clinton administration.  Accepted for admission  In recent years thousands of illegal immigrants have used fear of coercive birth-control measures in China to gain admission to the United States.

Two adults and two juveniles survived. They and the six others had become stranded in the rugged terrain Sunday after crossing the border. Temperatures soared over 100 degrees.

       " 'IMM-16066  PRIMARY  A Good Decision  LAST WEEK, the U.S. government granted political asylum to Ilyas Akhmadov, who was  the foreign minister of an elected, moderate, separatist Chechen government and has been in exile since 1999. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that last  month, one part of the  government, the Department of Homeland Security, dropped its appeal against another part of the  government: the immigration court in Boston that granted Mr. Akhmadov asylum   months ago. The DHS appeal had little foundation. After hearing Mr. Akhmadov\\'s case, the immigration judge pointed out that if he were returned to Russia, there was little doubt the Chechen leader would be \"shot without being afforded the opportunity to defend himself in a trial, as has happened to other members of the Chechen government.\" The subsequent appeal was widely believed to have been made not on the merits of the case, but as a favor to the Russian government, which considers Mr. Akhmadov a terrorist.  Not surprisingly, the Russian government  was displeased by the decision. \"Such acts do not correspond to the friendly spirit of Russian-American relations, and do not help the joint fight against international terrorism,\" the Russian foreign ministry declared. The Russian press was even more displeased by the National Endowment for Democracy\\'s recent decision to give Mr. Akhmadov a prestigious grant. \"A Grant for Anti-Russian Activity,\" blared one headline.  But the Bush administration\\'s decision to drop the appeal, while politically difficult, was the right one. The official explanation is that no links could in fact be found between Mr. Akhmadov and international terrorism. More to the point, Mr. Akhmadov is well known for denouncing terrorism, for opposing the use of suicide bombs and for working, as he puts it, for a \"negotiated peace\" in his country. To turn him over to the Russian government for arrest, interrogation and possible execution would have  meant accepting the Russian definition of all independent Chechen leaders as terrorists, a definition that simply doesn\\'t hold up to the facts.

A bill pending in Congress, called the CLEAR Act, would call upon local police agencies to detain people with civil as well as criminal immigration violations. Agencies that don\\'t sign up would face cuts in federal funds.  Some local police, though, say the move would destroy all the bridges they\\'ve built with minority communities while burdening them with an area of law considered more complex than the tax code.

The Japanese Immigration Bureau detained the 61-year-old Fischer on Tuesday at Narita International Airport in Tokyo at the urging of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  The arrest capped a cat-and-mouse game between U.S. authorities and Fischer, who shuttled among several nations, including Japan, the Philippines and Hungary, to avoid arrest. A grand jury in Washington charged him in 1992 with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by going to Yugoslavia for the chess match against Boris Spassky.

It has gone after the CIA, lax border controls, and gaps in the nation\\'s air-defense system. Now the Sept. 11 commission is readying what is likely to be a harsh assessment of Congress for failing to grasp the threat posed by al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups.  The panel, which is set to issue its final report July 22, is focusing some of its final investigative work on the role Congress played as warning signs of a potential terrorist attack in the United States piled up in the years before 2001.  \"Congress is not blameless in this,\" said former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, the panel chairman. \"They held very few hearings on terrorism. You can\\'t just let Congress off the hook.\"  Kean vowed early in the investigation that the panel would look hard at how Congress supervised the intelligence, immigration and defense agencies charged with protecting the nation. But unlike the performance of executive-branch agencies, the issue of congressional accountability seldom arose during the commission\\'s 12 public hearings.  When the panel has delved into actions taken by Congress, its findings have suggested that inertia and pressure politics interfered with national security.  That appears to have been the case in 1996 when Congress passed legislation ordering the Immigration and Naturalization Service, whose functions are now part of the Homeland Security Department, to develop a system for tracking foreigners in the country on student visas. The law followed the disclosure that one of the plotters in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing had overstayed his student visa.  ',\n",

The clashes began in midmorning, when 38 mortar rounds fell on a building used by Iraqi and American soldiers, demolishing a portion of the building. In the gun battles that followed for nearly four hours, American and Iraqi troops fanned out across the city. An American helicopter launched Hellfire missiles on a building suspected of housing insurgents, killing four, according to Master Sgt. Robert Cowens, a spokesman for the First Infantry Division.  Twenty American soldiers and four Iraqi guards were wounded in the fighting. The clashes killed 3 civilians and injured 20 more in Samarra, according to hospital sources cited by The Associated Press.  Mrs. Arroyo acted after the abduction of a Filipino truck driver in the Falluja area. Filipinos are among the legions of foreign workers who ferry goods, wash dishes and cook meals for American soldiers and contractors here. At roughly 4,000, their numbers overshadow the 51 soldiers the country's military has contributed to the United States-led coalition.  The abduction of the Filipino worker, identified as Angelo dela Cruz, a driver working for a Saudi company, was the latest in a spate of attacks on foreign workers. In a videotape broadcast on Al Jazeera on Thursday, militants threatened to execute two Bulgarian hostages unless the American-led forces released prisoners, Reuters reported.

More French Jews have been immigrating to Israel or buying properties here as potential havens, and the Israelis and the French are debating whether the trend is a result of a surge in anti-Semitic attacks in France or just a cyclical oddity.  The Jewish Agency, the quasi-governmental body responsible for settling immigrants, reported a doubling in the number of French Jews who arrived last year and in 2002, to more than 2,000 each year, compared with about 1,000 a year in the previous three years. By contrast, worldwide immigration to Israel has sharply declined during the Arab-Israeli violence.  Michael Jankelowitz, a spokesman for the Jewish Agency, said that as a result of attacks against Jews in France in the past three years, many Jews, particularly those whose religion is evident from their clothes, were feeling increasingly uneasy. Much of the tension has centered in working-class suburbs of Paris where Jews and Muslims mingle.  ''If they're made to feel uncomfortable, this is the place they've always dreamed of coming to,'' he said.  Some Jewish leaders in France contend that the Jewish Agency has sent squads of ''emissaries'' to recruit Jews for aliyah, or the return to Israel.

Homeland Security Undersecretary Asa Hutchinson said yesterday that the United States and Mexico had agreed to a pilot program, through Sept. 30, to repatriate illegal immigrants found in the Arizona-Sonoran Desert region.  \"The interior repatriation program is voluntary,\" Hutchinson told reporters. \"Eligible migrants who are apprehended entering the U.S. illegally will be offered the opportunity to return to their home via air or bus transportation.\"  The first flight is expected to be July 12, after the United States finalizes contracts for air transport. Mexicans who participate will be flown to Mexico City or Guadalajara and then bused to their home towns.  The program was touchy for Mexicans sensitive to U.S. interference in their internal affairs.  But Mexican and U.S. officials agree on the need to boost security along the 2,000-mile border to reduce the number of Mexicans who die each year making the illegal crossing in search of a higher standard of living in the United States.

       " \"IMM-16298  PRIMARY  Europe Knows It Needs a Lot of Immigrants. But It Also Fears Them.  TERRORISM has come to Europe. The Continent's economic growth seems to lag perennially behind that of the United States. But neither of those things topped the list of worries for some European business and political leaders who gathered here this week for an international business conference.  Instead, they worried about babies, or more specifically, about a lack of them. The tone was set by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former president of France, who presented a series of demographic projections indicating that many European countries would be losing population at a rapid rate within a couple of generations. Meanwhile, he said, nothing of the kind would be happening in the United States, thanks to immigration.  Those who remember the fears of the 1970's, when there was Malthusian talk of too many people using up the world's resources, might think that a time of falling population would not be all that bad.  In her 1995 novel ''Children of Men,'' P.D. James invented a time when, because of some environmental disaster, no babies had been born for decades. Real estate prices fell and some towns gradually lost all their inhabitants, but what made the situation unbearable was the fear the human race was vanishing.  There is no danger of that now, of course, at least not from demographic trends. Europeans have babies, just not enough of them to provide future workers to pay their parents' and grandparents' retirement benefits. The pay-as-you-go system seems to demand more workers just to finance benefits already promised.  \",\n",

Campos, who trains other would-be directors at Asociación Tepeyac, a Mexican social organization in Manhattan, trained her camera mostly on undocumented workers. Two of her immigration-themed films, the short documentaries \"Los Anonimos (The Anonymous Ones)\" and \"Mexican Link\" (co-directed by Javier de la Torre), are part of this year\\'s Nuestro Cine Latino Film Series, which begins Monday.  \"They\\'re about what it means to live and die in a city where you are not \\xadofficially recognized,\" says Campos.  \"People here see [Mexicans] working at coffee shops and delis, but they \\xadnever listen to what they have to say and never realize who they really are.  \"So one good thing about [Nuestro Cine] is that their voices are being heard,\" adds Campos. \"The screenings allow them to speak out.\"  The free festival, now in its third year, is focusing entirely on hot-button issues affecting the Mexican community. One night is devoted to short films by Mexican directors living in New York, several of them trained at Asociación Tepeyac.

The order is part of a stepped-up effort to stop employers from hiring illegal immigrants and to open jobs for American citizens.  Congress outlawed the hiring of illegal aliens in 1986, but enforcement has faded in the last six years. Doris M. Meissner, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, said in an interview: \"This whole area of employer enforcement has been moribund. There has been a steady decline in effort and resources directed at the workplace.\"  Immigration is becoming a volatile issue in the Presidential campaign, especially in states like California, Florida and Texas, and Mr. Clinton wants to make sure that Republicans cannot use the issue against him, Administration officials said. In Los Angeles eight days ago, Senator Bob Dole, the front-running candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, criticized Mr. Clinton\\'s record on immigration, saying the President had not helped California cope with the costs of illegal immigrants.  The Administration is already using the armed forces and local law-enforcement agencies to bolster the Border Patrol in Arizona and California. Mexico\\'s economic problems have increased the pressure for illegal immigration. Recognizing that many illegal immigrants are lured to this country by jobs, Congress recently directed the immigration service to double its corps of workplace investigators.  ',\n",

He writes of epidemics of trachoma, cholera, bubonic plague and typhus that occurred in association with immigration a century ago, and of outbreaks of AIDS and tuberculosis that have occurred in recent times. For each epidemic, he weaves a vivid description of the natural history of the disease with an account of how the disease entered the United States, spread and ultimately faded away.  Markel portrays these events through engrossing stories of individual victims who suffered the disease -- the East European rabbi with trachoma, the Haitian refugee with AIDS, the Chinese immigrant with bubonic plague. He describes the response of public-health officials to the epidemics and shows how these outbreaks shaped our society and changed our world. The continuity throughout these episodes is America\\'s habit of blaming the victim. We pride ourselves on being a nation of immigrants, yet we have a tradition of scapegoating newcomers when epidemics strike. Markel, who writes regularly for The New York Times and other general publications, tells these stories in an enthralling fashion. His ability to make medicine accessible and understandable to lay readers is remarkable. Yet, the book is also thoroughly researched, well argued and replete with insightful, nuanced interpretations. Scholars will find it of value as well.  ',\n",

But he could still face deportation if convicted of a felony in the now-active case.  Andres Morales is back in Hazelwood, the only home he can remember, after being held at the Mexican border for two months by U.S. officials who said an old drug case might keep him out of the country forever.  He returned last week after a St. Louis County judge allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea six years after the fact. But it is an incremental step for Morales, whose drug charge is thus made active again. Immigration officials could still deport him if it results in a felony conviction.  Morales, 26, helps his mother run the popular Pueblo Nuevo restaurant in Hazelwood. He was represented by Gene McNary, the onetime St. Louis County prosecutor and former county executive who later headed the Immigration and Naturalization Service. McNary now practices immigration law.  The reopening of his case was opposed by the office of Robert P. McCulloch, the current county prosecutor.  In March, Morales was returning after a visit to Mexico, from which his family moved when he was about 1 year old, when he was detained as he entered Texas. Immigration officials discovered he had pleaded guilty in 1998 of possessing marijuana with intent to distribute it, and served probation.

Local governments must take action because Congress will not.  Immigration is a federal responsibility, and the current problem is the result of years of dereliction of duty by Congress.

And at no time is the stress on the border more visible than the holidays, when immigration and customs officials say they are most overwhelmed.  At the San Ysidro crossing here, on one side of the toll gates, immigrants head back to Mexico for the holidays, their pickup trucks and vans packed with washing machines, teddy bears and cheap lawn furniture.

More than one million Mexicans will go south for the holidays, about half of them exiting through San Diego into Tijuana, officials say. Some are legal residents, but most, border officials say, are illegal immigrants, who in a month's time will pay thousands of dollars to have smugglers sneak them back to their jobs in the United States.

Last year, Mr. Islam and thousands of other Arab and Muslim men came forward to be fingerprinted, photographed and interviewed by immigration officials hunting for terrorists. Officials ultimately determined that almost none of them had links to terrorism. But Mr. Islam was in this country illegally, and the judge said he had no choice but to deport him.  ''You must leave the United States no later than Feb. 25,'' the judge, Gabriel Videla, told Mr. Islam, 63. ''Good luck, sir.''  Mr. Islam is one of nearly 13,000 illegal immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries who were placed in deportation proceedings after voluntarily participating last year in the nation's largest effort to register immigrants in decades. The counterterrorism program, created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was hailed as a success by Justice Department officials, who said they had arrested suspected terrorists and gathered vital information about more than 83,000 immigrants from countries considered breeding grounds for terrorism.  But though the program made the government aware of thousands of illegal immigrants like Mr. Islam, officials now say there is little evidence to suggest that it succeeded in capturing suspected terrorists.

Mr.  Demjanjuk, who was once thought to be the sadistic Nazi death camp guard known as Ivan the Terrible, has been found guilty of lying to gain entry to the United States. In April, a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court decision revoking his American citizenship on multiple grounds, including his ''willing'' service in a unit ''dedicated to exploiting and exterminating'' Jewish civilians in Nazi-occupied Poland.  A document filed Friday by the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security seeks Mr. Demjanjuk's deportation for his participation in Nazi-sponsored persecution while serving as an armed SS guard and because he lied about his wartime job and residences when he applied for an immigration visa in 1952. It was not clear where he might be sent.  The United States accused Mr. Demjanjuk in 1977 of being Ivan the Terrible at the Treblinka death camp.

Legislation signed yesterday by President Bush gives the Justice Department expanded powers to track down and deport immigrants who engaged in war crimes and human-rights abuses in their home countries.  The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act, introduced in Congress five years ago, was part of the intelligence overhaul bill that Bush signed into law.  Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.), who along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R., Utah) sponsored the bill in the Senate, said it updated the charter of Justice\\'s Office of Special Investigations, which was set up in 1979 to prosecute and remove Nazi war criminals who sought refuge in this country. The new law will allow Justice to investigate other war criminals, as well.  \"Now we can pursue the new generations of war criminals and human-rights abusers,\" Leahy said in a statement.  Rep. Mark Foley (R., Fla.), who sponsored the bill in the House with Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D., N.Y.), said 800 to 1,000 war criminals and human-rights abusers sought refuge in the United States every year from such countries as Haiti, Honduras, North Korea, Rwanda and Cuba.  \"The United States is currently home to many immigrants who fled torture in their home countries,\" Foley said in a statement.  \"What many people don\\'t know is that their torturers also come here to live,\" he said.

The American melting pot is bubbling over with obesity, a new study says.  People who move here from other countries start out relatively lean. But after they\\'re here a decade, their girth expands, largely because of fast-food cuisine.  \"The longer you live here, the more likely you are to adopt a traditional American diet, a higher-carbohydrate and higher-fat diet,\" said Dr. Mita Sanghavi Goel of Northwestern University, whose research is published in today\\'s Journal of the American Medical Association.  After less than a year in the United States, 8 percent of immigrants are obese, said the study, based on a national survey of more than 32,000 adults that uses self-reported height and weight. After 15 years, it\\'s 19 percent - near the 22 percent mark for people born here. (Studies that measure height and weight say that nearly one-third of Americans are obese.)  Immigrants start following the \"American weigh\" by adding pounds after 10 years, the study found.  The increase appears to be most prominent among white immigrants, followed by Latinos and Asians, Goel said. Black immigrants don\\'t significantly gain pounds.  With immigrants making up 11 percent of the U.S. population, the findings have major implications for efforts to curb the country\\'s obesity epidemic.

His \"nanny problem\" isn\\'t unique.  Nominations in the Bush and Clinton administrations died for the same reason. It was most ironic for Mr. Kerik, who as head of the Department of Homeland Security would have been responsible for protecting America\\'s borders.  Fighting terrorism is President Bush\\'s stated priority, which makes his administration\\'s slipshod vetting of Mr. Kerik that much more embarrassing. The Kerik fiasco similarly undermines Rudolph Giuliani\\'s credentials. Not only did the former New York City mayor recommend Mr. Kerik to the White House, Mr. Kerik is a partner in Mr. Giuliani\\'s security firm.  Nor was the nanny problem the only problem. In his personal business dealings and public life, Mr. Kerik would have faced ethics questions and abuse-of-power charges. If the president intends to fill Cabinet positions based on loyalty, the least he could do is nominate friends - or friends of friends - who are both qualified and clean.  Mr. Kerik\\'s downfall again demonstrates how many jobs illegal immigrants do for Americans and the need to build a system that lets them work in the open, where they can submit to security checks without risking deportation.

Immigrants being who they are, these hurdles are seldom insurmountable. Theirs is the energy of hope, and it's a powerful force.  Westchester Community College in Valhalla has begun a determined effort to tap that energy -- and to help pave the path to success for immigrants -- in a way that could set an example for the region. It has begun its largest-ever fund-raising effort to build the Gateway Center, a $35 million building that will consolidate the classes and services it offers to the foreign-born, who make up a large portion of its student body of 24,000.  The center will allow the school to expand its English as a Second Language program, which now serves 4,000 students. It will also offer job training, placement services and career guidance, and is envisioned as a social hub where the native-born and newcomers can meet, work together and learn from one another.  It's a practical idea, and an inspiring one. The New York area, like much of the rest of the country, is absorbing a huge wave of immigrants. The process has not always gone smoothly, particularly -- and predictably -- in the mostly white suburbs. A case in point is Long Island, where immigrants confront increasing hostility. Long Island's immigrant ranks include a considerable cohort of middle- and upper-class professionals. Those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder are more visible: the day laborers in construction and the men who mow lawns and clip hedges, waiting for work on the Island's shady streets and in its convenience-store parking lots. Besides the vagaries of weather and unscrupulous bosses, they endure insults -- and occasional violence -- from other Long Islanders who have let their suspicion of outsiders sink into hatred.  \",\n",

In 1993, The New York Times printed my statement containing the details of how I complied with all laws and regulations in employing Ms. Lucas. The statement is supported by my voluminous files, which date back to 1986, when I hired Ms. Lucas. I have copies of the many filings she and I made when I hired her, and the many more filings we have made since then.  When I hired Ms. Lucas, I made the required filings with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. During the entire time I have employed Ms. Lucas, I have promptly paid all taxes due, and Ms. Lucas has paid all income taxes due.  \",\n",

More than 600,000 Filipinos immigrated to the United States during the two decades of the Marcos regime, starting in 1965 when the American restrictions on Asian immigration were lifted -- the same year Marcos took power.  Like many who left, the Nasols chose the Bay Area because it had an existing Filipino community, ranging from the descendants of farmworkers to a budding group of medical professionals. Flor Nasol was a nurse and her husband was a mechanical engineer. Her aunt, a secretary at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Palo Alto, offered them free lodging.  Today, there are more than 321,000 Filipinos in the Bay Area, which does not include 54,000 who report on census forms that they are part Filipino.

Morales, 26, was arrested at the Texas border in March when he tried to return from a visit to Mexico. U.S. immigration officials had discovered he pleaded guilty in 1998 to possessing marijuana with intent to distribute. The felony guilty plea would require him to be deported from this country, immigration officials said.  It was crushing news for Morales, who had lived in Hazelwood since the age of 1, attended local schools, played soccer at St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley and enjoyed working in the family restaurant, Pueblo Nuevo, with his mother, Bertha Morales, and his sister.  The case epitomized the get-tough posture of U.S. immigration officials, who in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks have stepped up enforcement of immigration laws. Friends rallied around Morales, vouched for his character and described the deportation as too harsh a punishment for an activity that has involved all too many American teenagers.  Morales, however, found a way to remain with his family by withdrawing the guilty plea he made in 1998, then entering an agreement with prosecutors under which he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor for marijuana possession, said his attorney, Frank Kaveney.

The women will use the money - along with their contacts, graduate degrees and a triple dose of street savvy - to try to help New York\\'s undocumented immigrants escape loansharks and other financial predators.  Nearly 2.9 million immigrants live in New York - about 36% of the city\\'s population and a number equal to the total population of Chicago.  About 700,000 of those New Yorkers are undocumented. A cottage industry of ripoff artists preys on them daily.  Few undocumented New Yorkers have bank accounts, so they use check-cashing stores or stash money under the bed. Invisible to the conventional banking system, the same immigrants become ripe targets for loansharks and their legalized cousins, the payday lending companies that typically charge more than 500% interest for tiny loans.  Immigrants, particularly the undocumented, can hardly afford such usury.

Rodriguez, who in 1993 became the president of the United States\\' oldest and largest farm workers union, spoke at a party Wednesday at Eno River Unitarian Universalist Fellowship celebrating the contract with the N.C. Growers Association.  The contract unionizes more than 8,000 guest workers that the NCGA brings in from Mexico on short-term visas each year during the harvest season.  The workers are being organized under the Ohio-based Farm Labor Organizing Committee, which also signed a contract in September with the Mt. Olive Pickle Co.

An uncle in New York who is a U.S. citizen agreed to take care of Joseph.  But only the minors - among them Joseph's 17-year-old brother - were ever set free.  Joseph and the others remained locked up at the Krome Avenue detention facility outside Miami. Although asylum-seekers are entitled to remain free while their cases are pending, the government opposed releasing Joseph's group.

For example, American citizens need valid licenses to drive, hunt and fish; they would be arrested if found otherwise. However, illegal immigrants have been using fraudulent driver licenses, Social Security numbers, etc., while federal and state authorities have been looking the other way.  Why should illegal immigrants be granted amnesty and thereby be given licenses, just because they are here? Why do we have a Department of Homeland Security if our borders are to be, essentially, open?  Why should America\\'s citizens support the medical and social services of illegal immigrants, including the education of their children in our public schools? The open-border policy has allowed the United States to be the receiver of low-wage workers, thereby limiting American citizens, as well as legal immigrants, to the lower income jobs.  It is time for common sense on the part of both Democrats and Republicans to enforce existing laws that allow and account for only legal immigrants into our country; all illegal immigrants should be sent home. There is absolutely no reason why American citizens should be supporting the social services of illegal immigrants to this country.  CHARLES R.

The little-noticed legislation, tucked in a massive spending bill passed Saturday, would close a loophole in regulations for the L-1 visa, which is intended to allow foreign firms to transfer managers and employees with specialized knowledge to their offices in the United States.  Critics of the offshoring industry say that L-1 visas are used far more broadly and are being exploited to evade caps on the H-1B visa program for admitting temporary skilled workers. Last year, 57,245 L-1 visas were granted -- nearly one-third of them to Indian nationals.  The H-1B visa program, which helped provide workers for much of Silicon Valley's tech boom, has been controversial. Some tech workers and political leaders argue that the visas make it too easy for low-paid foreign workers to replace highly paid Americans in software programming and other skilled tech jobs.  Under political pressure from the critics, the annual quota for H-1B visas has been reduced to 65,000 in recent years -- not nearly enough to meet new demands from the offshoring industry. In response, India's largest software contractors have dramatically increased their reliance on L-1 visas.

Last month, Prince William County police arrested 24 laborers at the site and charged them with loitering. On  Monday, three more laborers were charged. Eleven of the men have been turned over to federal immigration authorities and face possible deportation.  Latino leaders have criticized the arrests as an excuse  to harass immigrants and deport them. After yesterday's meeting, about 75 day laborers and supporters marched from a church to a Mexican restaurant next to the 7-Eleven to protest the arrests.  The town hall meeting was organized by Supervisor Hilda M. Barg (D-Woodbridge), who is pushing for a permanent job assistance center where day laborers could gather.  Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.) told the crowd that Prince William -- where the percentage of Latinos has climbed from 9 percent to 16 percent in the past four years -- is not alone in dealing with this issue. Other parts of Northern Virginia have also struggled with it, Davis said, as  have communities across the country.  \",\n",

Mike Honda, D-Campbell, today will introduce a bill that could give permanent legal status to 275 Korean immigrants who are facing deportation after learning years later that their green cards were authorized by an immigration official in San Jose in exchange for bribes.  Last year, the federal government ruled that the green cards the immigrants obtained from veteran immigration official Leland Dwayne Sustaire were fraudulent.  In 1998, Sustaire confessed to a scheme of taking more than $500,000 from immigration consultants who were helping the Koreans obtain permanent legal residency, or green cards.  The fraud dated back to 1986. In 1999, Sustaire was convicted of the crimes in federal court.  In stories published by the Mercury News last year, the Korean immigrants, who came to the United States legally on various visas -- H-1B work visas, student and visitor\\'s visas -- denied they were accomplices in the scheme.  They said they paid the consultants to help them complete immigration papers filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, now known as the Citizenship and Immigration Services. They denied knowledge of the bribe scheme the consultants had with Sustaire.  \"It was our people who caused this. Why should these Korean immigrants be punished for the corrupt actions of a government official?\" said Honda by telephone on Thursday. \"I think it\\'s an issue of right and wrong, and I don\\'t see how any fair-minded legislator can say this is not a fair action to take.\"  ',\n",

       " 'IMM-16585  PRIMARY  A MEDICAL PREDICAMENT  Researchers at the Center for Immigration Studies estimate that in 2002, the national taxpayer cost of treating uninsured, undocumented U.S. residents was $2.2 billion, plus an additional $2.5 billion in Medicaid. The American Hospital Association estimates that U.S. hospitals spend \"millions, possibly billions\" treating undocumented residents, though no exact numbers are available because hospitals don\\'t ask residency status before giving treatment.  In Florida, there is no reliable estimate of how much the state spends treating undocumented residents, said Jonathan Burns of the Agency for Health Care Administration. But the often-cited worst-case scenario is that of Luis Jimenez, an undocumented Guatemalan landscaper who in 2000 racked up more than $1 million in expenses at Martin Memorial Medical Center, one-tenth of the hospital\\'s yearly budget for charity care.  In response to the Jimenez case, U.S. Rep. Mark Foley told The Palm Beach Post, \"We need to remedy this problem before we can no longer afford to take care of Americans.\"  Last year, Congress allocated $1 billion for hospital care in states that have large populations of undocumented residents. Florida\\'s portion was $9 million. The catch is that, to get the money, hospitals would have to ask patients their residency status. Many hospitals have balked. Doctors who work with the undocumented population say they have an obligation to treat anyone who needs help.  \"We look at it not as legal or illegal, but as human beings,\" said Pedro del Sol, director of the Caridad Clinic in Boynton Beach. Last year, volunteer doctors, nurses and dentists there had about 20,000 patient visits. The clinic manages that pace with a $1.2 million operating budget composed entirely of donations and grants - bumped up to about $3 million with in-kind donations of time and supplies - and an average cost of $29 per patient. It is constantly in need of more space and money to meet the ever-growing demand for services.  ',\n",

The passenger claimed to be Palestinian, but carried no identification. He wouldn\\'t say where he was going, or why.  Assuming they had caught an illegal immigrant looking for a better life in Europe, German authorities jailed the Arabic-speaking man in June 1999 and prepared to deport him. But they were unable to confirm his identity or figure out where to send him, so they moved him to a loosely supervised asylum camp for undocumented immigrants. Officials there paid little attention when he vanished two weeks before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States.  The man who would later be code-named \"Mohamed the Egyptian\" by his Islamic radical friends resumed his illegal travels across Europe in 2001, taking advantage of the continent\\'s open borders to move freely among Germany, Spain, France, Italy and possibly other countries.  Over the next three years, investigators say, he recruited volunteers for suicide missions, frequented fundamentalist mosques and played a key role in planning the biggest terror attack on European soil, the train bombings in Madrid on March 11 this year.  All along, Mohamed -- whose legal name is Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed -- was able to dodge police and counterterrorism officials in at least three countries. They repeatedly put him on watch lists under a variety of names, but failed to figure out what he was up to, according to interviews with European investigators and a review of court and immigration documents.

Joining him for his 20-hour stay in Mexico were five fellow cabinet secretaries.  Powell met with Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has made U.S. immigration changes a priority. Fox says the millions of Mexicans working in the United States should have legal status there so they can live without fear of arrest and deportation.  During his discussions, Powell said he reaffirmed President Bush\\'s \"plan to work with our new Congress to develop a temporary-worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing U.S. employers.\"  Bush and Fox agreed in 2001 to press for immigration changes, but the Sept. 11 attacks soured Congress on the idea.

Aboard a plane to Mexico City, where he and other top American officials were to meet Tuesday with their Mexican counterparts, Mr. Powell acknowledged that the administration had done little to press its proposal to reform immigration laws, announced with fanfare by Mr. Bush in January.

''But now that the election is behind us and the president is looking to his second term,'' he added, ''the president intends to engage Congress on it.''  Under the proposal announced by Mr. Bush, foreign workers with a job or job offer could get legal status for three years, with the possibility of renewal.  Employers would have to show that they had made an effort to find an American to fill the job before it could be offered to a foreigner.  The proposal faced opposition from some Congressional Republicans and Democrats, who said they feared that it would reward illegal immigrants with a fast track toward American citizenship, a claim Mr. Bush denied.  \",\n",

Other states made major decisions on marijuana. Alaska voters snuffed out a proposal that would have decriminalized use of the drug, while Montana approved its use for medicinal purposes.  And in Arizona, a new measure --- unique in the United States --- would require proof of citizenship for voter registration and proof of immigration status to receive certain government services.

The immigrant, David Wong, was convicted of fatally stabbing Tyrone Julius at the Clinton state prison in Dannemora, about 17 miles west of here .  Despite the lack of physical evidence or obvious motive, Mr. Wong, who was already serving time for armed robbery, was found guilty based on the testimony of two witnesses, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.  Mr. Wong's first significant victory came on Oct. 21, when five New York State appellate judges overturned the murder conviction and returned the case to Clinton County Court. The decision was the culmination of a long campaign for Mr. Wong, whose cause was first taken up by Asian-American advocates shortly after his 1987 conviction. Articles in The New York Times and inquiries by a Manhattan private investigator, coupled with the reversal of testimony by a crucial witness, raised doubts about Mr. Wong's guilt.  Judge Timothy J. Lawliss announced on Monday that jury selection for Mr. Wong would start Dec. 6. Since Mr. Wong, 42, has fulfilled his sentence for the robbery conviction, he is now being held at the county jail on $100,000 bail, awaiting the next phase, be it trial, deportation or freedom.  \",\n",

We are spooked by large gatherings of men in public places, like Columbus Park in Mamaroneck. We call the police to enforce rules against double-parking, loitering, urinating on the street or sleeping in the park. Many of us just wish the men would all leave, but they do not, and the problem festers.  There are, of course, legitimate reasons to object to the status quo. Local governments, whose responsibility is to ensure order, suffer the consequences of an inconsistent federal immigration policy. Contractors who skirt the rules distort the market place for those who check ID's and pay insurance and taxes. The laborers themselves are most at risk in the underground economy.  But while the frustrations of local residents are real, a community that wants the moral standing to confront them should first pass a test of basic decency.

The Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, in its analysis of Census Bureau data, also found that occupations with some of the highest unemployment rates among U.S.-born citizens tended to be in job sectors such as construction that had the largest influx of recent immigrants.  More recently arrived immigrants may be more willing to travel farther to find work and often get jobs by keeping in touch with relatives and friends across the country, said the report\\'s author, Steven Camarota.  \"We find little evidence for the argument that immigrants only take jobs that natives don\\'t want,\" Camarota said.  Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, pointed to the weak labor market as the main culprit.  Bernstein gave the example of a native-born worker in a lower-skilled occupation who may not want a job with lower wages or poor conditions that an immigrant has. So reducing the number of immigrants in the labor force possibly could lead more employers to improve wages and benefits, which in turn would attract more U.S.-born workers.  \"There\\'s something to their argument, but not the right conclusion from this evidence,\" he said. \"I\\'m more interested in generating a much more robust low-end labor market much like we had in the 1990s.\"  ',\n",

For anyone who writes about immigration, as I do, this is a familiar question. It was posed to me again this week as I read e-mails from readers who have been distressed with my views on illegal immigration. Put simply, many dislike the fact that I do not condemn outright those immigrants who are here illegally.  Last week I replied to a few dozen of those readers and asked them to relay a personal experience that has helped shape their current view of illegal immigration. Some described horrors of being victims of Mexican gang violence, others shared their plans to pick up and move out of their homes in frustration over what they consider the disrespectful behavior of Hispanic newcomers in their neighborhoods.  Many sounded particularly tired of politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, big business and the media that seem happily blind to the impact that immigrants have on jobs and communities. The rage is real and is echoed in the 49 percent of Americans who want to reduce immigration, according to a Gallup poll in July.  For more than 50 years it has been illegal to enter the country without proper documentation. Yet for many it is obvious that the law is not enforced sufficiently, if at all. Indeed there are not endless busloads, trainloads or planeloads of people being deported in an effort to rid the country of the estimated 8 million to 12 million illegal immigrants currently living here.

This global problem requires more than the old answer of shoving the ones who make it past the borders into a shadowy existence, and warehousing the rest.  Germany and Italy have called for setting up processing centers in North African countries like Libya, Tunisia and Morocco to screen prospective refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. This troubling proposal is driven in part by a rising populist backlash against asylum seekers in these two countries. Without any clear understanding on how these camps would function -- especially in countries not known for their protection of human rights, and in the absence of a common European policy on refugees -- this is a bad idea. This week, it encountered firm resistance from France and Spain, whose new center-left government has been far more welcoming toward all forms of immigration than its conservative predecessor. A similar suggestion recently came from the interior ministers from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria and Slovakia. They expressed concern about Chechen and other refugees and proposed setting up transit camps in Ukraine. Understandably, the Ukrainian government bridled at the suggestion, not least because nobody sought its opinion.  \",\n",

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials questioned a man they had believed was the driver, but he turned out to be a passenger, said Arizona Department of Public Safety Sgt.  Brian Preston.

Five people died at the scene of the 11-car crash Saturday, and one victim died later at a hospital. Of the 15 injured, one person was on life support and six were in critical but stable condition, Preston said.  James Lee, 74, and Emilia Lee, 71, of Huachuca City, were killed when the pickup hit their car and several others after swerving to avoid tire-damaging spikes placed on the road by police.
